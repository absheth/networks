   First lady Nancy Reagan was saluted Monday night
for her sense of style and her contribution to the American fashion
industry.
   Mrs. Reagan was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by
the Council of Fashion Designers of America at its eighth annual
awards ceremony, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
   ``There are many pluses and minuses to being in the White House.
One of the pluses is trying to help an industry that is one of the
most important in our country and I think the American fashion
designers are the best,'' said the first lady, who was wearing a
brilliant red floor-length gown designed by Oscar de la Renta.
   ``And when I found myself in the position to make others aware of
that, or at least try to, I was delighted to do so,'' she added.
   Broadcaster Barbara Walters, in presenting the award to Mrs.
Reagan, said the first lady and the president, during his eight
years in office, ``gave us pride, gave us hope, gave us style ...
that intriguing, all-encompassing word that says so much. Style.
Presence. A sense of beauty. ... Nancy Reagan has style.''
   Prior to the awards ceremony, de la Renta, president of the
council, said of Mrs. Reagan: ``I think she put American fashion on
the pedestal where it belongs and brought elegance back to American
fashion.''
   Designer Donna Karan said of Mrs. Reagan: ``The contribution to
fashion she has made goes beyond her clothing to her sense of
sophistication, caring and elegance as first lady of the United
States.''
   Calvin Klein, accompanied by his wife Kelly, said: ``She has
shown how women can look so well-groomed, so attractive and so
American.''
   Mrs. Reagan has been criticized for borrowing much of her
high-priced wardrobe while living at the White House _ a practice
critics said amounted to free advertising for the designers whose
clothes she wore.
   But Ms. Walters said she thought a first lady should be
``encouraged to borrow'' because it ``stimulates American industry.''
   Her comment caused the 500 ceremony guests to applaud vigorously.
   Mrs. Reagan had worn the de la Renta gown she wore to the
ceremony on at least three other occasions, said Wendy Toler, a
spokeswoman for the first lady.
   Also among those recognized at the ceremony was designer Geoffrey
Beene, who was saluted for making ``fashion as art.''
   Performer Liza Minelli, one of many women attending the ceremony
who dressed in Mrs. Reagan's favorite color, red, presented the
Perry Ellis award for new fashion talent to Isaac Mizrahi, whom she
called ``a brilliant and startling talent.''
   Ms. Minelli wore a floor-length gown with a leg-revealing slit
designed by Mizrahi.
   Actress Audrey Hepburn, wearing a red gown designed by Givenchy,
presented a Lifetime Achievement Award to photographer Richard
Avedon, for his ``pictorial contribution to American fashion and his
photographic reportage of historical events.''
   Bill Robinson received the award for menswear design. Nina Hyde,
fashion editor of The Washington Post, was recognized for her
reporting on American fashion.
   Karl Lagerfeld, designer for the house of Chanel, received a
special award for his international fashion influence.
   Grace Mirabella, former editor-in-chief of Vogue magazine, was
recognized for her promotion of American fashion in the media.
   Judith Peabody, a member of the board of directors of the Gay
Men's Health Crisis Inc., received the council's special
humanitarian award.

<HEAD>Former Nazi Propagandist Seeks Refuge In Canada</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Yale University lecturer who was
stripped of his American citizenship in 1986 for his role as a Nazi
propagandist in the Soviet Union during World War II has asked for
refugee status in Canada, a report said Monday.
   Vladimir Sokolov disappeared in July when he was scheduled to
appear at a deportation hearing in Hartford, Conn.
   His whereabouts were unknown until he applied for refugee status
in Montreal sometime before Jan. 1, claiming that his life would be
in danger if he was forced to return to the Soviet Union, the
Canadian Broadcast Corp. reported.
   No date has been set for an immigration hearing, the report said.
   From 1942 to 1944, Sokolov was a writer and editor of a Russian
language newspaper published by the German army in his hometown of
Orel, 220 miles south of Moscow. Anti-Semitic articles appeared
under his name, although he has maintained that the most offensive
tracts were written by Nazi censors.
   His Canadian lawyer, Julius Grey, said Sokolov faces almost
certain death if deported to the Soviet Union.
   ``The Soviet press has been gloating over his return and have
called him a traitor,'' Grey said. ``He would likely be put to death
or given a lengthy sentence. For all practical purposes it would be
the end of his life.''
   Grey, a noted constitutional lawyer who is also defending
convicted murderer John Joseph Kindler from extradition to the
United States where he faces the death penalty, said the 75-year-old
Sokolov is in very poor health.
   Sokolov failed to reveal his wartime activities in 1951 when he
entered the United States as a displaced person. He became a citizen
in 1957 and two years later began lecturing on Russian language and
Soviet dissident literature at Yale.
   His past was uncovered by the Yale student paper in 1976 and he
later resigned. But the U.S. government waited until 1982 before
filing a complaint to strip him of his American citizenship.

<TEXT>
   Four former Ku Klux Klan members entered
guilty pleas in federal court Monday for their part in a violent
clash in 1979 with black marchers.
   The four were the last of nine former Klan members who were
indicted and eventually pleaded guilty to federal charges stemming
from the gunfire in a Decatur parade that wounded several people.
   There were no fatal injuries in the 1979 confrontation. The
wounded included police officers.
   Two of the former Klansmen _ Ray Winford Steele and William
Riccio _ pleaded guilty Monday to a felony count of obstruction of
justice and a misdemeanor count of conspiring to violate civil
rights.
   The other two _ William Johnny Mason and Lynwood White _ pleaded
guilty to the misdemeanor conspiracy count.
   The former Klansmen were accused of blocking a Southern Christian
Leadership Conference march on May 26, 1979. The marchers were
protesting the prosecution of a mentally retarded black man charged
with the rape of a white woman in Decatur.
   The misdemeanor conspiracy count carries a maximum sentence of
one year in prison and a $1,000 fine. The felony count carries a
maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   U.S. District Judge John Hancock delayed sentencing for up to a
month.

<HEAD>1986 Tax Reform Benefits Farmers When Income Grows, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department analyst says the 1986
tax reforms can mean substantial savings to farmers when incomes
rise but that the old federal rules allowed bigger breaks as
earnings decline.
   Clifford V. Rossi of the department's Economic Research Service
said the Tax Reform Act of 1986 can reduce overall tax liability for
farmers by an average of 4.5 percent from previous levels.
   Rossi used a computer model and information from more than 15,000
federal tax returns of ``farm sole proprietorships'' for 1982 to
come up with the estimates. His findings were in a new staff report
circulated by the agency.
   Farm sole proprietorships were defined as ``self-employed
individuals filing a Schedule F federal tax form,'' which is the
basic paperwork required of farmers by the Internal Revenue Service.
   ``In general, lower marginal tax rates and generous expensing
provisions will offset repeal of the investment tax credit and
capital gains preference,'' the report said. ``Taxpayers with high
off-farm incomes receive little benefit from the new law.''
   Rossi noted that farm incomes can vary greatly because of
weather, economic conditions and other factors. So he performed a
``sensitivity analysis'' that includes a 25 percent increase and
another that includes a 25 percent decrease on farm income.
   The increase in net farm income resulted in a 10.9 percent
increase in federal tax liability under the old rules and only an
8.3 percent increase under the 1985 law, he said.
   By contrast, Rossi showed that a 25 percent drop in income would
result in a decline of 8.7 percent in taxes under the old federal
system and only 7.7 percent less under the new reforms.
   ``In terms of net winners and losers from tax reform, taxpayers
engaged in field crop and general livestock operations benefit more
from the new tax laws than other farm groups,'' he said. ``All
sectors, with the exception of the dairy sector, experience net
reductions in tax liabilities under tax reform.''
   Rossi said dairy farmers suffer under the new tax law ``because
of low taxable incomes that consequently cannot offset the loss of
capital gains preference'' and investment tax credit, two of the
major writeoffs under the old law.
   ``Farm enterprises with relatively high capital intensities are
burdened more by the loss of certain preferences for capital
intensities than other farm operations,'' he said. ``There is also
some evidence that more generous expensing and depreciation
provisions are of greater consequence to capital-intensive
operations than other farm types.''
   Rossi said the 1986 law ``tends to reduce tax burdens for
taxpayers with low and moderate levels of income'' and that those
whose taxable incomes were more than $500,000 showed the smallest
decline in taxes.
   According to Rossi, the new study is ``the only comprehensive
assessment of tax liability in the agricultural sector'' and will
aid in future policy considerations.
   ``If history is any indicator of future activity in tax policy,
the Tax Reform Act of 1986 will undergo refinement or overhaul in
the years ahead with accompanying effects on agriculture,'' he said.

   Tokyo continues to be the most expensive world
capital for groceries, according to the Agriculture Department.
   A 16-city survey by the department's Foreign Agricultural Service
in November showed that a retail market basket of selected food
items cost more than $144 in Tokyo, while the lowest cost was in
Brasilia at $27. In Washington, D.C., the same items were about $53.
   In order, the 16 capitals and market basket costs included:
Tokyo, $144.10; Stockholm, $99.92; Bern, $96.62; Seoul, $63.25;
Madrid, $59.64; Paris, $56.89; Rome, $58.64; London, $55.63;
Washington, D.C., $53.26; Bonn, $51.59; Canberra, $49.77; Ottawa,
$49.41; Buenos Aires, $40.99; Mexico City, $31.94; Pretoria, $31.17;
and Brasilia, $27.08.
   The agency said the food items ``reflect purchases more typical
of U.S. consumers rather than those of other nations'' and that
caution should be used in making comparisons. Differences in
quality, packaging and seasonal variations in supply were cited.
   Among the items, sirloin steak was shown at $10.71 per kilogram,
or about $4.87 per pound, in Washington, D.C., and $57.06 per
kilogram, or $26 per pound in Tokyo. In Brasilia, sirloin was $2.75
per kilo, or $1.25 per pound.
   The comparisons were begun by USDA many years ago to bolster
claims that Americans pay lower prices for food than many other
people in the world.

   Rising food prices in China may help spur
greater interest in imported U.S. farm commodities, according to an
Agriculture Department trade report.
   ``The combination of rising incomes, inflation fears and the
expression of pent-up consumer demand for almost everything has
created a sellers' market for most agricultural goods as well,''
according to the report in the January issue of Ag Exporter magazine.
   Higher prices for grain, livestock and dairy products are
expected to encourage imports of breeding animals, feed grains,
soybeans and meal, and wheat and wheat flour, the report said.

<TEXT>
   One of every three men and women walking down
the aisle in the United States has been married before, but the
remarriage rate for divorced Americans has been declining, according
to a National Center for Health Statistics report.
   The government report also shows that most divorced men marry
divorced women and that of those divorced Americans remarrying in
1983, the women were on the average 34 years old and the men, an
average 37 years old.
   The report is based on samples of records from states that
compile marriage and divorce statistics. It studies data collected
from 1970 to 1983, the latest year for which most of the figures
were available.
   The number of remarriages increased during the period studied,
rising from 404,000 in 1970 to 736,000 in 1983 for divorced women
and from 423,000 to 773,000 over the 14-year period for divorced men.
   But although the number of remarriages was growing over those
years, the pool of divorced men and women was growing faster, the
report said.
   In 1983, the remarriage rate for divorced women was 91.6 per
1,000 compared with 123.3 per 1,000 in 1970. The rate for divorced
men was 142.1 per 1,000 compared with 204.5 per 1,000 in 1970, the
report said.
   ``Thus, only 9 percent of divorced women and 14 percent of
divorced men remarried in 1983, compared with 12 percent of divorced
women and 20 percent of divorced men in 1970,'' the report said.
   The figures also show that most women marry men of the same
marital status. In 1983, the report said, 55 percent of all women
and men who married were both single, 19 percent were both divorced
and 2 percent were both widowed.
   Men traditionally are older than the women they marry, and this
generally holds true for remarriages as well as first marriages,
according to the study. The only combinations in which that trend is
broken is for divorced and widowed women who marry single men. In
1983, widowed women were an average 2 years older and divorced women
were an average 1 year older than the single men they married.
   Many of the patterns for first marriages don't hold up for second
and subsequent marriages, the report noted.
   While more than three-quarters of first marriages are performed
in religious settings, the proportion drops to about 60 percent for
marriages involving divorced men and women.
   Also, first marriages have a typical seasonal pattern _ many more
are performed in the summer than in the winter, the report said. But
second and subsequent marriages tend to be spread more evenly
throughout the year.

   Two employees of a McDonald's Restaurant
were fatally shot during a robbery Sunday and a suspect was arrested
hours later at a Wilmington, Del., bus station, officials said.
   Robert P. Hughes IV, 21, of Glen Mills, was arrested at about
8:40 a.m., said Wilmington police Sgt. Richard Andress. Hughes was
charged with resisting arrest, carrying a concealed deadly weapon
and was held as a fugitive, Andress said.
   In Pennsylvania, Hughes was charged with two counts of murder,
two counts of criminal homicide, robbery and weapons violations,
said James P. MacElree II, Chester County district attorney.
   Extradition proceedings probably will begin this week, Andress
said.
   Restaurant manager Jean Reider, 41, of Newark, Del., and Charles
Hegarty, 46, of West Chester, were killed in the holdup, which
occurred before the restaurant had opened, police said.

<TEXT>
   Fear that the U.S. government will go it alone
in world trade is discouraging other countries from joining in an
accord that could cut spending on farmers by tens of billions of
dollars every year, according to a report published by the
International Monetary Fund.
   Fund experts see a possibility that James M. Baker III,
designated as secretary of state by President-elect Bush, will
single out favored countries as trading partners instead of
promoting U.S. trade with the whole world.
   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, whose
members include the governments of the major industrial countries,
says farm subsidies cost consumers and taxpayers $185 billion a year
between 1984 and 1986. The biggest costs are in the United States,
western Europe and Japan.
   The IMF report cites a speech last year by Baker, then secretary
of the treasury. Baker spoke of what the U.S. government would do if
there were a failure of the trade talks now being held by
representatives of 96 countries.
   ``We might be willing to explore a `market liberalization club'
approach, through mini-lateral arrangements or a series of bilateral
agreements,'' Bush was quoted as saying.
   Bilateral agreements are like the new one between the United
States and Canada, freeing up trade between two countries but
tending to freeze out others. A similar deal with Israel was made
earlier last year. A ``mini-lateral'' arrangement includes not just
two but a group of countries, like the 12 in the European Economic
Community.
   Groups of this kind encourage trade among members at the expense
of those outside the club.
   The report was written before last month's meeting in Montreal of
representatives from the 96 governments. They agreed on how to
negotiate 11 different kinds of trade issues in the remaining two
years of talks. But they failed to agree on four others, including
agriculture.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter insisted that other
governments, especially the Europeans, promise to join in a
long-term phase-out of subsidies before he would talk about cutting
them in the immediate future. Bush has picked Yeutter as his
secretary of agriculture.
   On Thursday Alan Holmer, Yeutter's deputy as trade
representative, said he was optimistic about agreement being reached
on farm issues by April, a new deadline set at Montreal. But
negotiations are being soured by a fight between the European
community and the Reagan administration over the hormones that U.S.
farmers use to make their cattle grow faster.
   Last Sunday the community, which tries to keep its own farmers
from using hormones, banned imports of U.S. beef and veal worth over
$100 million a year. The Reagan administration retaliated with
increases of 100 percent in import duties on such items as Danish
hams and sun-dried tomatoes from Italy, a measure designed to make
them too expensive for Americans to want to buy. The Europeans are
threatening a counter-reprisal and U.S. officials say they have a
list ready should that happen.
   A truce is in effect at least until Jan. 23, when ministers of
foreign affairs from the 12 countries are due to meet in Brussels.
Bush will have been inaugurated three days earlier and the new
administration may have some ideas for getting the talks back on the
rails. Yeutter is to be replaced as trade representative by Carla
Hills.
   The report published by the International Monetary Fund is called
``Issues and Developments in International Trade Policy.'' It was
written by a team under Margaret Kelly, an Australian who heads the
fund's Trade and Payments Division.
   The fund is owned by 151 countries, with the United States
holding the biggest block of votes.

   General Douglas MacArthur and others directing
the occupation of Japan after World War II resisted powerful U.S.
and allied opposition in keeping the late Emperor Hirohito on the
chrysanthemum throne, where he reigned for another 43 years.
   The emperor's prosecution for war crimes, execution, imprisonment
or exile was favored by 70 percent of Americans in a public opinion
poll seven weeks before the end of the war. Some allied governments
had similar views.
   MacArthur, supreme commander of the U.S. occupation of Japan, was
the best known of those resisting demands for punishing the monarch
who died in Tokyo Saturday at the age of 87 after a 62-year reign
marked by military expansion, crushing defeat, reconciliation,
dramatic economic growth and new heights of prosperity and prestige
for his country.
   Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and six other Japanese officials were
convicted and hanged as a result of the Tokyo war crimes trials.
Tojo's testimony at one point threatened to implicate the emperor in
whose name the militarists had overrun East Asia.
   Documents released in Washington 25 years ago by the State
Department show that MacArthur and other U.S. officials decided
retention of Hirohito was vital to maintaining order in the former
enemy country and carrying out their mission of democratic reform.
   But those planning Japan's future were also aware that the
emotions of war had generated powerful sentiment in America and
other allied countries for prosecuting and ousting the mikado as
responsible for aggression and atrocities of the imperial military
command, the documents showed.
   George Gallup, director of the American Institute of Public
Opinion, declared June 23, 1945, that ``the average American''
thinks Hirohito ``should be treated like any other war criminal.''
   In his latest Gallup poll, he said, 33 percent of those
questioned said Hirohito should be executed, 17 percent said ``let
the court decide his fate,'' 11 percent said ``keep him in prison
the rest of his life'' and 9 percent wanted to exile him. Only 4
percent favored ignoring him as a mere figurehead, 3 percent said
``use him as a puppet to run Japan.'' Other replies or no opinion
accounted for 23 percent.
   MacArthur wrote in his memoirs that Hirohito had already been
stricken from the list of potential war crimes defendants when the
monarch first visited him Sept. 30, 1945. Hands trembling, the
emperor offered to bear sole responsibility for the war, MacArthur
wrote, adding that, ``I knew I faced the First Gentleman of Japan in
his Own Right.''
   Four months later, the five-star general messaged Washington that
Hirohito's indictment and execution could trigger a convulsion,
potential chaos and guerrilla warfare in Japan. One million
occupation troops might be needed and ``all hope of introducing
democratic methods would disappear,'' MacArthur said.
   George Atcheson Jr., MacArthur's State Department adviser, told
Truman in 1946: ``There is no question that the emperor is most
useful. He is obeyed ... he manifests sincerity in wishing to aid in
the accomplishment of our general objectives and is seemingly more
anxious to be democratic than some of the people around him.''
   A specialist strongly advocating retention of the emperor was
Hugh Borton, member of the U.S. State-War-Navy coordinating
committee in Washington that began studies before the end of the war
on occupation policy and sent its findings to MacArthur.
   Reached at his home in Conway, Mass., Borton, now 83, said the
committee favored keeping Hirohito on the basis of expert opinion
that ``he was one who could more influence the Japanese populace
than anyone else, and the important thing for the United States was
to make the occupation as effective as possible rather than a
continuation of the war.''
   First indications, in August 1945, that the emperor might be
retained produced a strong but mixed reaction in Congress. Sen. Tom
Stewart D-Tenn., said the emperor is ``a war criminal and I'd like
to see him hung up by his toes.''
   Sen. William Langer, R-N.D., said the emperor ``ought to be
treated like Hitler.''
   Sen. Richard Russell, D-Ga., who later introduced an unsuccessful
resolution urging trial of the emperor, called anything less than
unconditional surrender ``a terrible mistake.''
   But Sens. Styles Bridges, R-N.H., Elbert Thomas, D-Utah, and
Robert Taft, R-Ohio, said it should be possible to deal sternly and
effectively with Japan and simplify military operations by working
through the emperor.

   President Reagan's submission today of his
$1.15 trillion federal budget for fiscal 1990 triggers a work
schedule that is specified by law, cited with reverence by lawmakers
and then routinely ignored.
   This year should be no different.
   The law calls for Congress to have completed work on the spending
plan by April 15. In addition, all 13 appropriations bills that
finance the federal government are supposed to be in place by the
Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year.
   But that rarely happens, and ingredients for delay abound this
year.
   Congress will be treating Reagan's proposal as largely
inconsequential and waiting for a new plan from President-elect Bush
after his inauguration. The House Budget Committee isn't even
planning any hearings on Reagan's blueprint and will wait instead
until it receives something from Bush.
   In addition, Bush's repeated pledges to avoid new taxes puts him
in direct conflict with many congressional leaders who say the
additional revenues will be unavoidable.
   ``There probably hasn't been a year in the last five where the
likelihood of keeping to the budget schedule is less likely,'' says
Stanley E. Collender, the Washington-based director of federal
budget policy for the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse.
   This hasn't stopped top members of Congress from their usual
pledges to move quickly on the budget.
   Last Monday, Congress' first day in session, House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, set a goal of meeting budget deadlines and said,
``So far as the speaker can influence the schedule, we shall perform
our work on time.''
   And new Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn.,
expressed the same desire in a telephone interview last week, adding
that the delay caused by the presidential transition ``doesn't waive
the provisions of the law'' setting the budget work schedule.
   But history shows that fiscal and political crises, not
timetables, govern the budget process.
   Budget deadlines set by law come and go with no real consequences
if they are missed.
   But three key fiscal events are scheduled to occur roughly
simultaneously this fall and are likely to spur action in what
Collender, borrowing from the language of New Age adherents, calls
``the political equivalent of the harmonic convergence.''
   Sometime this August or September, the government is expected to
reach its debt ceiling of $2.8 trillion, meaning that legislation
will be needed for it to be able to borrow more money.
   At the same time, if there is no budget agreement between
Congress and the White House, the mechanism will begin that
ultimately triggers the dreaded automatic spending slashes required
under the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. Those cuts _ which are
seen by most people as draconian _ would take effect Oct. 1.
   In addition, September is the last month of the fiscal year. Some
sort of legislation that provides money must be in place by Oct. 1
or the government cannot function.
   Stalemates are common when it comes to the budget because the
blueprint is the most basic statement of the government's
priorities. It not only perpetually creates institutional struggles
between the executive and legislative branches, but it is a
battleground for Democrats and Republicans positioning themselves
for future elections.
   Last year was unusual for its budget harmony because most of the
crucial decisions were made at a summit among Reagan administration
officials and congressional leaders shortly after the October 1987
stock market crash. It was the first year in 12 in which all 13
spending bills were finished by Oct. 1.
   In 1987, spending legislation was not completed until nearly
Christmas, three months into the fiscal year.

   Prince Charles has angered British farmers by
linking intensive farming methods with erosion and the destruction
of wildlife.
   ``People are becoming increasingly concerned about the damage to
the environment arising from the application by farmers of the
principle of the maximization of production,'' he said in an address
to an organic food production conference this weekend.
   ``It is increasingly felt by members of the public that
large-scale soil erosion, the destruction of wildlife habitat and
the excessive use of chemicals and unnatural substances are
unacceptable and cannot continue without ruining the countryside for
future generations and probably causing long-term health hazards.''
   National Farmers' Union President Simon Gourlay said the prince
had ``gone over the top in sounding the alarm bells and I do not
think he's justified in saying there's a buildup of long-term
environmental problems.''
   Charles has shown a penchant for voicing public concerns, most
notably in the field of urban development and architecture.

   Shoes have put former U.S. Rep. John
Jenrette back in the news.
   The South Carolina Democrat, who was convicted in 1980 in the
FBI's Abscam investigation, faces charges of petty larceny for the
theft of a pair of shoes and for altering price tags at a suburban
Washington, D.C., department store, authorities said.
   He is scheduled to go to trial in Fairfax County, Va., on Feb. 1,
said his lawyer, Warren McLain.
   ``It was a silly, silly mistake,'' Jenrette said Saturday, adding
that if he hadn't lost his temper over the Dec. 7 incident, the
arrest ``probably wouldn't have happened.''
   Jenrette said he was trying on a pair of rubber work shoes at the
store when he heard that cars parked outside were being towed. He
said he walked outside with the shoes on because he thought he had
parked his car in a ``questionable area.''
   Two security guards immediately ``jumped on me,'' Jenrette said.
An argument ensued and ``the next thing I knew they signed a
warrant.''
   Jenrette also denied charges that he altered prices on a pair of
pants and a shirt from a clearance table.
   Following Abscam, his former wife, Rita, appeared seminude in
Playboy. She wrote a book about how she and Jenrette made love at
the U.S. Capitol and how she found $25,000 stuffed in his brown
suede shoe.

   Thirteen-year-old Drew Barrymore, the lovable
little girl in the movie ``E.T.,'' said agents hired by her mother
put her in handcuffs to take her back to the hospital after her
binge of substance abuse.
   In September, she said, she took a break from her initial
hospital stay for drug and alcohol use to audition for a play in New
York, and broke her 88-day string of sobriety when she snorted
cocaine in a nightclub restroom.
   She said she then stole her mother's credit card, flew to Los
Angeles, snorting more cocaine, and went on a shopping spree.
   Her mother hired private agents who handcuffed her and sent her
back to the hospital, according to her first-person account in this
week's People magazine.
   She said her descent into drug and alcohol abuse began with her
rise in fame. ``From the time I became famous in `E.T.,' my life got
really weird,'' Miss Barrymore said.
   Miss Barrymore was released from her second stay at a
drug-and-alcohol rehabilitation hospital shortly before Christmas.
She said she drank at age 9, smoked marijuana at 10 and snorted
cocaine at 12.
   ``It was frightening. I was this 7-year-old who was expected to
be going on a mature 29,'' she said. ``By the time I was 8{, I felt
like I was some abnormal, crazy girl. I could walk up to the door of
any nightclub and they'd say, `Hi, you're that little girl. Come
in.'''
   Last June, after a beer binge, Miss Barrymore had a showdown with
her mother and ``started throwing things _ glasses, vases. They were
breaking all over the floor. I went from party girl to jerk of the
planet.''

   Singer Chuck Berry thinks the nondescript terra
cotta building at 2120 S. Michigan Ave. should take its rightful
place as a historic location in the development of urban blues.
   ``I recorded some of my biggest hits at that address,'' Berry
recalled recently. ``I have a lot of memories of it. They were great
days of great music.''
   The building once was the mecca for the nation's blues musicians
_ the home of Chess Records. This week, the Commission on Chicago
Landmarks will consider the nomination of the two-story building for
city landmark status.
   During the 1950s and 1960s, passersby might have seen Howlin'
Wolf, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, the Dells, or the Rev. C.L. Franklin
and his daughter, Aretha.
   Bluesman Willie Dixon said he would like to make the building the
national headquarters for his Blues Heaven Foundation, which raises
money for music scholarships, and perhaps a blues museum.
   ``It is part of the history of America,'' Dixon said. ``Remember,
all rock is the blues by rearrangement. And the blues should have a
place, a home, so the world knows where they came from.''

<HEAD>Town Looks To City-Owned Utility For Lower Electric Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCH WEISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLYDE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city manager is on the verge of flipping a
switch that will send electricity flowing through city-owned power
lines, a change he says will save money for residents of this
northern Ohio town.
   But officials for the Toledo Edison Co., which now supplies
electricity to the town's 5,600 residents, say a municipal power
system will be unreliable and electric rates will eventually
increase and surpass their rates.
   City Manager Nelson Summit admits that the Clyde Light and Power
Co. is a gamble.
   ``What it boiled down to was I felt there was a better way to
provide electricity. It turned out that it is going to be cheaper
and rates will get a lot better in the future,'' Summit said in a
recent interview.
   But Toledo Edison is putting up a fight.
   It filed a lawsuit last month after the city refused to start
negotiating the renewal of the private company's franchise to serve
the city. The contract expires in June 1990.
   Toledo Edison wants to force Clyde to explain to the state Public
Utilities Commission why the company should not be allowed to
compete with the new municipal system in Clyde, about 30 miles
southeast of Toledo.
   Toledo Edison will lose about $7 million to $8 million annually
in revenues if the franchise is not renewed, said Mark Everhart,
general manager of the utility's eastern district.
   The utility has 275,000 customers in northwestern Ohio. ``Losing
Clyde is kind of like cutting the heart out of a distribution
system,'' he said.
   The conversion to a city-owned system had its beginnings five
years ago when Summit moved to Clyde and saw his electric bills
double.
   Voters in November 1987 approved a $10 million bond issue to set
up the utility company. Early last year, the city agreed to buy
power wholesale from the Canton-based Ohio Power Co. at 3.1 cents
per kilowatt hour.
   The city wanted to buy Toledo Edison's distribution system, but
the company's selling price of $30 million was too high, Summit said.
   Now, Clyde is building a new substation, distribution and
transmission lines. Its first customer, a Whirlpool Corp. plant, is
expected to be on line in early March, Summit said.
   The City Council recently set rates for the new system at 7 cents
per kilowatt hour. The current rate is 9.5 cents and the average
household pays $52 a month. That's expected to drop to $39.
   More than 80 Ohio communities have municipal electric systems,
most buying power wholesale from utilities, but no municipal system
has been set up since the early 1900s.
   Clyde's operation is being closely watched by other Ohio
municipalities interested in cutting electric rates.
   ``There is no doubt about it, a precedent has already been set
and Toledo Edison is worried,'' Summit said.
   But there are several inherent problems with municipal power
systems, Everhart said. In coming years, some cities may have
trouble buying power wholesale because supplies will diminish, the
utility company official said.
   ``A no-frill utility company will work fine until the wind blows
hard, until there is a major accident and until something goes
wrong. And then all of a sudden, you are left holding the bag,''
said Everhart.

   A Belfast-bound jetliner carrying 126
people crashed beside a highway in central England on Sunday and
broke into pieces, killing at least 37 people and injuring 76,
officials said.
   The airline said the crash was caused by engine failure and ruled
out sabotage.
   The British Midland Airways Boeing 737-400 was en route from
London's Heathrow Airport to Northern Ireland when it developed
engine trouble, the Civil Aviation Authority said.
   The jet attempted to land at East Midlands Airport near
Nottingham, about 100 miles north of London, but undershot the
runway by a half-mile and crashed alongside a highway, smashed into
an embankment and broke apart, police said.
   Witnesses reported seeing an engine in flames as the aircraft
came in low, dropping bits of debris and shearing off treetops as it
careened toward the highway. Cars swerved to avoid the hulk and
there were a few minor injuries from auto collisions, police said.
   ``We believe that 37 people have died as a result of this
accident, but there are still some people in the wreckage,''
Leicestershire Assistant Chief Constable Tony Butler told a news
conference.
   He said he did not know whether the trapped people were dead or
alive. It was also not certain that all 37 were aboard the plane,
since police reported there may have been casualties in cars on the
highway.
   After nearly eight hours of rescue efforts at the edge of
England's busiest north-south highway, one of the people aboard was
still trapped alive in the wreckage and two bodies awaited recovery,
the Leicestershire Ambulance Service said.
   Police in the county of Derbyshire reported several bodies
scattered on each side of the highway. Two nearby hospitals reported
a total of 76 people injured.
   ``All of them seemed to have smashed ankles and legs, and with a
lot, their faces were badly damaged too,'' said Joe Weston-Webb, 50,
who lives in the nearby village of Sutton Bonningale and was among
the first on the scene. He helped rescue several people and saw many
bodies in the wreckage.
   ``It seems a miracle that any one got out alive though, and I
can't believe that it all didn't go up in flames. It was
horrendous.''
   The plane, a new aircraft that only had been in service for three
months, was carrying 118 passengers and eight crew, the airline said.
   The crash was the second major air tragedy in Britain in three
weeks. On Dec. 21, a Pan Am Boeing 747 bound for New York blew up
over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on
the ground. That jet had also left Heathrow. A bomb was blamed for
the crash.
   The flight Sunday took off from Heathrow Airport at 7:52 p.m. and
its engine caught fire 10 minutes later, the Department of Transport
said.
   The pilot told the control tower he had the engine fire under
control, but when the plane was still one to two miles out, ``it was
clear that there would be an accident,'' airport official Michael
Cowan told a news conference.
   `As the plane approached the control tower it was apparent it was
too low,'' he said.
   Airline executive Colin Roberts told relatives at Belfast
Airport, ``There was absolutely no question of sabotage and there
was nothing to indicate that whatsoever.''
   The accident was caused by a technical fault in one of the
engines of the new plane, which had made seven flights on the
London-Belfast route, he said. The weather was reported good.
   The 737 crashed at about 8:30 p.m. (3:30 p.m. EST) about a mile
outside the village of Kegworth, Inspector Neville Cotterill of the
Leicestershire police said.
   The tail section as embedded in the ground and the fuselage broke
into several parts spread over fields, Cotterill told The Associated
Press.
   But he added that no cars were known to have been hit as the
plane thundered alongside the M1, England's main north-south highway.
   The highway was closed as dozens of ambulances and fire engines
converged on the scene. Cries for help could be heard from inside
the fuselage. Personal belongings littered the highway.
   Rescuers dug steps into the embankment and formed a human chain
from the wreckage to the ambulances. They flattened trees and hacked
open the fuselage.
   The cockpit with a large chunk of fuselage came to rest in thick
brambles and trees near the top of the embankment.
   The pilot, Capt. Kevin Hunt, was hospitalized with multiple
injuries, British Midland said.
   A local vicar, the Rev. Michael Brandon, said he held a
passenger's hand and whispered the Lord's Prayer to him as he died.
   ``It was very dignified and peaceful. There is not a lot more you
can do in a situation like this,'' he said.
   The crippled jet roared over 16-year-old Samantha Phelby's house
just before it hit the ground.
   ``We looked outside as it got louder and as it was going overhead
we saw the left engine still on fire. Then we heard this pop, which
could have been the crash. Then we heard the fire engines,'' she
told Independent Radio News.
   Desmond Anderson, who lives 400 yards from the airport's main
runway, said, `The far side engine was on fire, backfiring and
roaring away ...
   An Automobile Association manager, John McKnight, said: ``There
are still people trapped and work is going on to free them. From the
reports I have had there is a terrific amount of wreckage. It's a
hell of a mess.''
   British Midland chairman Michael Bishop said said the pilot
reported ``severe vibrations in one of the engines'' and asked
clearance for an emergency landing at the airport.
   Bishop said the company had taken delivery of the plane only 12
weeks ago.
   Civil Aviation Authority spokeswoman Ann Noonan said the pilot
reported problems in his No. 2 engine and was having trouble
climbing. The two-engined aircraft disappeared off ground control
radar screens at 8:15 p.m.
   The Boeing 737-400 is a version of the Boeing 737 with a longer
fuselage and can carry 146 passengers. It was introduced last year.

   Political parties are struggling to emerge in
this British colony but face the formidable hurdles of apathy,
public distrust and a wary Communist China, which gains sovereignty
over the territory in 1997.
   Attempts to form the groups comes as Britain prepares to hold
Hong Kong's first general legislative elections and China appears to
have reluctantly dropped its opposition to such activity.
   The organizations will be different from Western-style political
parties because they will not be able to form a sovereign
government. Instead, they will be limited to trying to influence the
outgoing British rulers and pursuing whatever local power Beijing
permits under the ``high degree of autonomy'' it promises for this
capitalist enclave after 1997.
   ``The administration of Hong Kong will be in the hands of Hong
Kong people, so in that sense we still have a lot of power,'' said
Yeung Sum, chairman of Meeting Point, a pressure group of about 300
members that views itself as a future party.
   In recent weeks, businessman Stephen Cheong and lawyer Martin
Lee, both members of the colony's Legislative Council, have
announced plans to form political parties. Councilor Maria Tam's
Progressive Hong Kong Society also is mentioned as an emerging party.
   Those groups are expected to participate in general elections to
be held in 1991 for 10 of 56 seats on the council, which is
primarily a forum to debate policy made by the British governor and
his advisers. The council now consists of government officials,
government appointees and representatives of interest groups and
local advisory boards.
   The 1991 elections ``will be run on party lines, I'm quite
sure,'' said Joseph Y.S. Cheng, a political scientist at the Chinese
University of Hong Kong. But the groups will face huge problems in
gathering support from Hong Kong's 5.7 million people, who
traditionally distrust political parties.
   Families who fled to the coastal enclave blame China's myriad
20th century woes on both the Communists and Nationalists, who moved
to Taiwan after the 1949 revolution. Both parties operate
unofficially in Hong Kong.
   ``People in Hong Kong feel very comfortable with the status quo,
and they are afraid of political activities, political
confrontation,'' Cheng said.
   Yeung acknowledged that Meeting Point had not clearly declared
itself a political party for so long because ``all through the
years, people (have been) skeptical of the label.'' Cheong rejects
the ``party'' label for his new group.
   Political scientist Peter Harris of the University of Hong Kong
believes the groups will have trouble winning broad backing. He said
``the mass of the Hong Kong people are more interested ... in
getting the kids to school. Their understanding of issues is still
in a very inchoate stage.''
   Attempts by civic leaders three years ago to form political
parties stalled not from apathy but because of China's opposition,
according to Lee.
   That stance appears to have softened, however, with the onset of
legislative elections that China has promised will continue after
1997.
   Xu Jiatun, China's main representative in Hong Kong, said early
this month that the new constitution being drafted for the territory
effectively allows political parties.
   Many of the emerging political groups have not clearly stated an
ideology and may be identified primarily by the personality of their
leaders. Some of those leaders may seek to become Hong Kong's first
chief executive, which will be the top local post after the British
leave.
   Cheong said his group will call for stability and only gradual
political change, while Lee is the territory's most vocal advocate
of sweeping democratic reform. Three-year-old Meeting Point's goals
include a high degree of self administration for the territory after
1997, a central social security fund and more education subsidies,
Yeung said.
   Lee believes the major issue dividing the parties will be whether
they speak primarily for Beijing or Hong Kong interests.
   One big question is whether the Chinese Communist Party in Hong
Kong, which now works behind the scenes, will go above ground to
openly participate in elections.
   ``That would frighten the industrialists away, immediately,''
said Lee.
   Despite the growing activity of local political groups, Harris
sees little hope for them to wield real power, noting that
authoritarian Communist countries such as China do not accept
challenges to their rule.

   An earthquake with a preliminary reading of 5.1 on
the Richter scale shook a small island south of Tokyo today, the
Central Meteorological Agency said. There were no immediate reports
of damage or injuries.
   The tremor, which occurred at 12:15 p.m. (10:15 p.m. EST Sunday),
was centered at about 12 miles under the seabed south of Miyake
Island, about 100 miles south of Tokyo, the agency said.
   It said another undersea earthquake of lesser magnitude hit the
same area 36 minutes earlier. No magnitude was available for the
first quake.
   The island is home to 4,300 people.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its
epicenter, according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale is considered ``very
strong,'' a reading of 6 means ``severe,'' and capable of widespread
damage near the epicenter.

   They were lukewarm about the Declaration
of Independence and the Constitution. They opposed the War of 1812.
And in presidential elections they voted against their neighbor,
John Kennedy, and their governor, Michael Dukakis.
   The people of this Cape Cod community have never gone with the
flow and they show no signs of changing as they celebrate
Barnstable's 350th anniversary this year.
   ``I hate to use the cliche Yankee independence, but I suspect
there is an aspect of that,'' said Patricia Duffy, who has been
helping compile a lengthy history of the town for use in the school
curriculum. ``We are cautious. We don't jump on any bandwagons.''
   Barnstable lives in the shadow of its neighbors Hyannis and
Hyannisport, made famous by the Kennedy clan.
   But Hyannis and Hyannisport are not officially incorporated as
towns; they are merely two of seven villages in the town of
Barnstable, which occupies the midsection of the cape.
   Barnstable is the principal municipality of Barnstable County,
which encompasses all of Cape Cod. It's the state's third largest
community geographically and has a year-round population of about
35,000 that doubles during summer.
   But few outside New England know its name, although residents
hope to change that with a 12-month celebration that promises much
variety, if little peace and quiet.
   Festivities include a summer rowing regatta, a colonial costume
day, a publishing party for the Cape Cod Almanac, and a Boston Pops
concert on the Hyannis town green.
   The big celebration comes in early September, the actual
anniversary month, and includes a visit by a delegation from
Barnstable's namesake, Barnstable, England.
   The events the town will commemorate began in September 1639,
when Barnstable was incorporated under a land grant from the Plimoth
Colony.
   The town history describes reaction to the American Revolution as
mixed, with wealthy Tories quarreling with patriots over British
domination. John Crocker, whose ancestors were among the town's
first 45 inhabitants, puts it in physical terms: ``In the Crocker
Tavern (still standing) there is a gouge out of one of the beams
where a couple of fellows had a sword fight over the issue.''
   The town neither endorsed nor opposed the Declaration of
Independence. A town meeting initially voted against the U.S.
Constitution because it lacked a bill of rights.
   ``The people were more wealthy down here and they were tending
toward the status quo,'' said Robert O'Leary, a social studies
teacher.
   Early thriving industries included cranberry harvesting, which
survives to this day, shipbuilding, lumbering, oystering and
extraction of salt from the ocean. Today tourism dominates.
   Because of the importance of sea trade to Barnstable, the
townspeople opposed the War of 1812 against Britain. This time there
was no give to their position: Isaiah L. Green, the area's U.S.
representative, voted for the declaration of war and lost his seat,
according to the school department history.
   Residents remember the Kennedy era fondly. They speak of John F.
Kennedy parading through town after his Democratic presidential
nomination, and of his victory speech in Hyannis after the 1960
election.
   But at the polls, residents favored Richard Nixon by 4,515 to
2,783. They had no greater favorite-son feelings last year, when
George Bush beat Dukakis 10,026 to 9,971.
   Joseph Kennedy brought his family to Hyannisport in 1926 but it
wasn't until his son became a national figure that the sandy beaches
and sunshine of Cape Cod gained national attention and later
unrestrained development, say local historians.
   ``The beauty, uniqueness and excitement of the cape portrayed by
the press put Barnstable on the map and in the world spotlight,''
according to the school department narrative.
   Cape Codders regret some of the growth, as they showed last fall
when they supported a non-binding resolution in favor of a building
moratorium. Former U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas, a Cape Cod summer
resident, said the problems on Cape Cod are as much aesthetic as
environmental.
   ``Much of what has been built on Route 28 in Hyannis is
schlock,'' Tsongas said. ``If the development that took place was
architecturally consistent with the cape, it would not have been
half as offensive as it is.''

   The number of students entering nursing school
jumped 11 percent last year because of higher salaries and a healthy
job market, according to the magazine that surveyed more than 220
schools.
   The increase follows a nearly a one-third drop from 1983 to 1987.
   Schools responding to the annual survey, to be published today by
the trade magazine Nursingworld Journal, had a total of 15,494
freshmen in 1988, up from 13,970 in 1987.
   ``Probably the most important thing is that there has been so
much publicity about the national shortage of nurses,'' Publisher
Richard A. DeVito, said Friday.
   But a more troubling factor, DeVito said, is that many schools
have reduced entry level grade point averages to attract more
applicants. Perhaps as a result, he said, graduate nurses failed
their licensing exams at a record rate of 16 percent in 1988, four
times the 1987 level.
   The journal said it sent its survey to 1,491 U.S. nursing schools
and received responses from 227 institutions in 44 states.
   Hospital officials hailed the finding as good news for the
nation's health care system, which has been strained by a
``significant and persistent shortage'' of nurses, according to a
December report by the Commission on Nursing of the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services.
   About 300,000 nursing jobs were unfilled nationwide, the American
Nurses Association estimated last year.
   DeVito said the shortage has had a direct impact on wages,
pushing up starting salaries for registered nurses by an average of
$5,000 to $6,000 during the last five years. Registered nurses now
typically start at $22,000 to $28,000 a year, depending on region,
and experienced nurses earn up to $55,000 in some cities, he said.
   According to the survey, licensed practical nursing programs
experienced the greatest increase in beginning students in 1988,
with a 25.4 percent jump. Hospital-based diploma programs were next,
with a 14.6 percent rise.
   Baccalaureate programs at four-year colleges and universities saw
a 10.7 percent increase. The smallest change was in associate degree
programs offered by two-year junior colleges, which reported 8.7
percent more freshmen.
   DeVito cautioned that because of the decline in entrance
requirements, the overall increase of 11 percent may not necessarily
translate into an 11 percent rise in the number of graduates.
   ``The problem it's going to create is that while we have roughly
a big increase in freshman enrollees, they've lowered the admission
standards, so we may have fewer people who are going to be able to
make the grade,'' he said.

<HEAD>Method Used In Media General-Associated Press Poll On Homelessness</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Poll-Homeless, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews Nov. 10-20 with 1,084 adults in the
continental United States. The phone numbers were selected randomly
by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the
most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult
American were asked the same questions the results theoretically
would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19 of 20 times. The
error margin is larger for subgroups _ 4 points for women, for
example, and 5 for Democrats.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. In your opinion, how serious a problem is homelessness in the
United States? Is it very serious, fairly serious, not too serious,
or not serious at all? Very: 68 percent. Fairly: 24. Not too: 5. Not
at all: 1. Don't Know or No Answer: 2.
   2. Do you think the problem of homelessness is getting worse,
improving, or staying about the same? Worse: 68. Improving: 3. Same:
24. DK-NA: 5.
   3. Who do you think should be primarily responsible for helping
homeless people _ the federal government, state government, local
government or private charities? Federal: 32. State: 24. Local: 18.
Charity: 9. DK-NA: 17.
   4. Do you think federal spending on helping the homeless should
be increased, decreased or remain the same? Increased: 60.
Decreased: 6. Same: 27. DK-NA: 7.
   a. (If increased) Would you be willing to pay more taxes for
that? Yes: 86. No: 11. DK-NA: 3.
   5. Thinking about why most people are homeless, would you say
society is mainly at fault, or the homeless personally are mainly at
fault? Society: 45. Homeless: 33. DK-NA: 22.
   6. Do you think homelessness is a problem only in big cities, or
in communities of all sizes? Cities: 24. All sizes: 74. DK-NA: 2.
   7. Does the federal government do enough to prevent people from
becoming homeless, or not? Yes: 27. No: 58. DK-NA: 15.
   8. Should the federal government build more subsidized housing
for poor people? Yes: 65. No: 27. DK-NA: 8.
   9. How about people who are homeless _ should the federal
government spend more to provide them with housing? Yes: 62. No: 27.
DK-NA: 10.
   10. Should people be allowed to live on the streets if they want
to? Yes: 45. No: 51. DK-NA: 4.
   11. Are there homeless people in your community? Yes: 59. No: 37.
DK-NA: 4.

<HEAD>Attorney General Says Administration Did Not Try To Thwart Walsh
Inquiry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the
Reagan administration did not try to thwart independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh from pursuing his investigation of the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Thornburgh said Sunday that Walsh had assured him before dropping
two key charges against Oliver North that he had been dealt with
``in good faith'' and had gotten ``full cooperation from the
intelligence community.''
   Thornburgh's comments on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley'' came after questions of whether he realized his
administration's decision to withhold some classified evidence on
national security grounds would force the prosecutor to drop some
charges against the fired National Security Council aide.
   The attorney general said he himself was concerned about any
impression ``there was some kind of cover-up or stonewalling of the
independent counsel's office.''
   In a meeting Wednesday, the day before Walsh moved to drop the
charges, Thornburgh said he asked for Walsh's personal assurance
``that he had been able to follow every line of inquiry that was
available, that he had had full cooperation from the intelligence
community, and that ... everyone he dealt with had acted in good
faith.''
   Walsh ``had no hesitation in satisfying my concerns on that
score,'' said Thornburgh. Walsh has not commented publicly on the
matter.
   Thornburgh said it was ``inherent'' that if the documents were
withheld, it ``would have an eroding effect on the quality of the
government's case'' against North. But ``the decision was Judge
Walsh's.''
   Thornburgh said that apart from revealing national security
secrets, a criminal trial on the original charges probably would not
have revealed anything ``that would surprise anybody'' in light of
the Tower Commission report and congressional investigation of the
Iran-Contra affair.
   North is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 31 on a dozen remaining
felony counts, including obstruction of congressional and
presidential inquiries, false statements to Congress and improperly
converting travelers checks belonging to the Nicaraguan Contras to
his own use.

   Americans generally agree that homelessness is
widespread and worsening, and most are dissatisfied with the
government's response and would be willing to pay more taxes to
combat the problem, a poll has found.
   A plurality of the 1,084 adults surveyed in the Media
General-Associated Press poll primarily faulted society rather than
the homeless for homelessness.
   A plurality also said the federal government is chiefly
responsible for solutions.
   The poll exhibited the broad reach of homelessness: Six in 10
said homeless people were in their communities, and three-quarters
said the problem plagues communities of all sizes, not just big
cities.
   Accordingly, respondents rated the problem as extraordinarily
severe. Sixty-eight percent called it ``very serious'' and 24
percent said ``fairly serious.'' The remainder gave it less
importance.
   The national poll, conducted by telephone among a random sample
of adults Nov. 10-20, had a 3-point margin of error. It was
completed before winter's cold increased attention on the homeless.
   Still, nearly seven in 10 respondents said homelessness was
getting worse, a quarter said it was unchanged, and 3 percent saw
improvement. The remainder had no opinion.
   Views were divided on the responsibility for solutions.
Thirty-two percent said the federal government was primarily
responsible; 24 percent said state governments, 18 percent said
local governments and 9 percent said private charities. The rest had
no answer.
   Wherever prime responsibility lies, only 27 percent said the
federal government was doing enough to prevent people from becoming
homeless, and 58 percent said it was not. The remaining 15 percent
had no opinion.
   A solid 60 percent said federal spending on programs for the
homeless should be increased, and 86 percent of that group said they
would be willing to pay higher taxes for that purpose. That totaled
52 percent overall, an unusually high level of acquiescence to
higher taxes.
   On specific programs, 62 percent said the federal government
should spend more on housing for the homeless, and as many favored
the preventive measure of building more federally subsidized housing
for the poor.
   In virtually all these measures, homelessness was seen as severe
and worsening by a greater share of women, Democrats, liberals,
minorities and younger people. They also were more apt to blame
society and to favor a greater federal response.
   Seventy-eight percent of women rated the problem as ``very
serious,'' compared with 56 percent of men, for example.
Eighty-three percent of Democrats said it was getting worse,
compared with 54 percent of Republicans. And sixty-four percent of
liberals said society was at fault, compared with 37 percent of
conservatives.
   An economic division also existed among respondents, with lower
income Americans more likely to view the problem as serious and to
favor greater responses. Of those with family incomes less than
$25,000 a year, for instance, 73 percent favored more subsidized
housing, but among those earning more than $50,000 just 54 percent
agreed.
   The survey found split views on the issue of people living on the
streets by choice. Of those with an opinion, 45 percent said people
should be allowed to live on the streets if they want to, but 51
percent said they should not have that right.
   Finally, the survey asked who was mainly at fault for
homelessness _ society or the homeless themselves. Forty-five
percent said society was primarily to blame; 33 percent said the
homeless and 22 percent had no answer.

<HEAD>It's Income vs. Spending As Legislatures Convene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA BARNAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Aid to education, prison overcrowding, insurance reform, property
tax relief and the environment are among the issues challenging
state lawmakers this year, but none looms as large as the battle of
the budget.
   It's income vs. spending, and if revenues are up, so are costs of
services. Just to stay even is more expensive, without talking about
adding money for things like schools, road repair or social services.
   ``What we face in the coming months will not be easy,''
Connecticut Gov. William A. O'Neill said last week in his
state-of-the-state address. ``We will have to say `No' when we
really want to say `Yes.'''
   Some states, including Alaska, California, Connecticut, Iowa,
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New York and West Virginia, are
running in the red or face deficits in the coming fiscal year.
Others, like Illinois, have avoided deficits by no-frills budgets
and face a backlash from the lean years.
   A lucky few are running surpluses, heating up debate on what to
do with the largesse.
   Caution abounds. New York and Massachusetts saw surpluses of a
few years ago turn to deficits _ at least $636 million in
Massachusetts' current $11.6 billion budget and more than $1 billion
in New York's budget of more than $28 billion.
   States expecting to do well this year _ Hawaii, Kansas,
Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Idaho and Maryland _ are
fearful of the same thing happening to them.
   ``It's real easy to make a tax cut right now, and we all look
good for re-election,'' says Hawaii House Finance Committee Chairman
Joseph Souki. ``But is that the wisest thing?''
   Lawmakers, having read voters' lips, are loath to talk about
hiking taxes. The idea is being mentioned mainly in the states with
the biggest money woes, and the most likely candidates are increased
taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and gasoline, rather than raising state
income taxes.
   Spending on education has perhaps the highest priority. Even in
West Virginia, with a fiscal headache totaling $680 million,
Gov.-elect Gaston Caperton has promised unspecified raises to the
state's teachers, who rank 46th nationally in salaries. Illinois
education officials, who have gone two years without a significant
budget increase, are expected to seek increases totaling more than
$600 million this year.
   Coupled with increasing aid to education is the need in some
states to restructure the system for public school financing to
reduce the disparities between rich and poor districts. Montana's
Legislature must fashion a new system to replace one that a state
court last year declared unconstitutional.
   Prisons are another big-ticket item. Michigan is in the middle of
a massive prison building program; by 1991, the state will have
spent $900 million to build 28 prisons, and if projections hold
true, the system still will be overcrowded.
   ``The cost of operating prisons is eating us alive,'' said
Michigan Senate Appropriations Chairman Harry Gast.
   Virginia is building two new prisons to increase its inmate
capacity by 2,600, but corrections officials say the state still
will be at least 1,000 beds short in a few years and more money will
be sought.
   ``The cost of crime is expensive, so we must accept the fact that
the money drawn to support the criminal justice system is money that
we will not have for the wide range of other important needs
throughout the commonwealth,'' said Gov. Gerald L. Baliles.
   Once lawmakers have their budget priorities settled, they still
won't lack for issues.
   Rising auto insurance costs are expected to be debated in New
Jersey, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. And California is awaiting
the results of a court challenge to Proposition 103, a voter
initiative passed last November that requires a 20 percent rate
rollback for most kinds of insurance and tougher state regulation of
insurers.
   The environment and waste disposal is another sore spot for some
states. New Jersey suffered a second consecutive summer of beach
closings because of high bacteria levels and medical waste washing
ashore, and the Legislature passed a series of measures designed to
help clean up the state's ocean waters.
   However, other proposals to track the disposal of medical waste,
impose tougher penalties on polluters and create a powerful
commission to protect the coast remain mired in disputes.
   South Carolina residents are clamoring for reductions in the
amount of hazardous waste buried in a landfill used by more than 30
other states, and the Legislature is studying ways to deal with
rapidly filling solid-waste landfills, also a consideration in New
Hampshire.

   A second Japanese old soldier has hanged himself
after leaving a note that he wished to follow Emperor Hirohito in
death, police said today.
   A passer-by found the body of Yohichi Terunuma, 76, hanging from
a tree on a local shrine's grounds Sunday afternoon, said Akira Iida
of the police department in Katsuta, about 60 miles northeast of
Tokyo.
   Iida said a note found in Terunuma's jacket pocket read in part:
``Allow me to follow the generalissimo ... as a solider.''
   Emperor Hirohito, once considered a living god and the supreme
figure in Japan's armed forces, died Saturday of intestinal cancer
at age 87. After World War II, the emperor renounced his divine
status and a new constitution defined his role as symbol of the
nation.
   Terunuma had served as an ensign in the former Japanese Imperial
Navy during World War II.
   On Saturday, an 87-year-old man who once served with the Japanese
Imperial Army hanged himself in a shed near his home in Wakayama,
280 miles southwest of Tokyo. He also left a note saying he wanted
to follow the emperor in death, police said.
   In Japan's feudal days, there were cases in which samurai
warriors killed themselves, following their lords in death. In the
best known case in modern history, Gen. Maresuke Nogi and his wife
committed suicide on the day of Emperor Meiji's funeral in 1912.

   A flock of ducks that waddle
through yards and dirty the streets has prompted a neighborhood
civil war of sorts in which both sides are crying foul about the
other's tactics.
   The domesticated Muscovy duck population has swelled to 200,
prompting some to begin efforts to reduce their numbers. The methods
have included egg stealing, trapping, maiming, and ducks being run
down by motorists.
   ``The ducks got caught in a people problem,'' says Jim
Vanairsdale, a pro-duck member of a committee named by the City
Commission to try to resolve the yearlong dispute. ``It's sad what
has happened.''
   Those in favor of the ducks claim the animals were in the
Woodland neighborhood when the middle- to upper-class area was
established more than 20 years ago. Opponents say the birds are too
aggressive, leave droppings underfoot and mate in public.
   Many in this oceanside city of 3,200 people agreed the duck
population should be reduced, and the dispute has been focused on
how many ducks would be allowed. For some people, one Muscovy is one
duck too many.
   A duck trapper was hired to relocate the ducks to Georgia, but
there were questions about the humaneness of his trapping methods.
   The St. Augustine Humane Society helped catch others, but they
relocated them too close, enabling some to return.
   The ducks are such an emotional issue here that they dominated
three monthly meetings of the St. Augustine Beach City Commission.
One meeting erupted into name-calling before Commissioner Pete
Dodson suggested last summer that a committee find a solution.
   ``I agreed to act as a moderator. Two people from each side were
appointed to act as a committee,'' he said.
   ``We've got to live together and stop this monkey business.''
   At the committee's first meeting, Dodson asked each member to
tell him how many ducks should be allowed.
   The numbers began at zero, with the average being 17, which
became the standard.
   Then Bill Van Marter, a former city commissioner who had
supported ridding the neighborhood of Muscovy ducks, complained in
August that his wife and granddaughter were attacked by a rogue
drake in their back yard.
   Mrs. Van Marter, who declined to be interviewed, told officials
at the time that she was forced to fling the bird, ``as big as a
turkey,'' into a nearby palm tree to stop the attack.
   After the attack, the committee voted to reduce the Muscovy
population to nine adult birds, where it stands.
   Efforts also were started to filch eggs from nests.
   But when reports surfaced that motorists were purposely running
down the ducks and that ducks were being maimed by having their legs
hacked off, the dispute intensified.
   Kathryne Grove, who witnessed one of the ducks being run down,
said: ``I was sick at my stomach. Why would anyone have to murder
them or run them down?''
   During a recent 30-minute tour of the 80-home area, only six
ducks were spotted, including one getting a douse from a hose
wielded by a woman trying to get it off her property.
   The Florida Aubudon Society has little good to say about the
Muscovy ducks, a domesticated version of the wild ones in Mexico and
South America.
   ``These things are a cancer. They are not supposed to be here,''
said Wes Biggs, state coordinator of the society's Florida Breeding
Bird Atlas Project.
   ``They are a real nuisance and we would be better off without
them,'' he said, adding that ``little old lady bunny huggers''
compound the problem by feeding them and treating them as pets.
   But now that the duck population has been lowered, Dodson
believes the situation will improve.
   ``I'm very optimistic the problem will be solved,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pro-Democracy Leader Released From Shanghai Jail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China today released a 33-year-old dissident who
was active in the pro-democracy movement in Shanghai and whose case
was taken up by the U.S. Congress.
   Yang Wei, a former student at the University of Arizona, walked
from Ti Lan Qiao Prison in Shanghai today after serving one year of
a two-year sentence.
   Fu Fenghao, an official at the Shanghai Foreign Affairs office,
said because Yang spent about a year in custody before being
sentenced, he was let out on time.
   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Yang said his
first concern upon release was the health of his father, who has
cancer.
   ``I'm going to see him today,'' said Yang. ``He is in the
hospital and he is in serious condition.''
   Yang was sentenced in December 1987 for ``demagogical propoganda
for counterrevolutionary ends.''
   He had been held without charges since January 1987 in connection
with pro-democracy student demonstrations in Shanghai in 1986.
   Yang said he did not regret marching for democracy and writing
for ``China Spring,'' the banned periodical of the Chinese Alliance
for Democracy, a New York-based dissident group. But he said he was
unclear whether he would continue working for political change in
China.
   ``I just got out,'' he said, ``so I don't really understand
what's happening in society. When I determine that then I will make
a decision.''
   Yang described his treatment in prison as ``pretty good.''
   ``It seemed that I was given special treatment,'' he said.
   Yang, who received a master's degree in molecular biology from
Arizona, said he wanted to return to the United States to continue
his studies.
   Sources close to the family said Yang's release was delayed by
several hours today because three members of the Chinese Alliance
for Democracy were apprehended in Shanghai over the weekend with
copies of ``China Spring'' and a letter for Yang.
   The alliance was set up in 1983 by a former Chinese citizen to
promote democracy in China. Chinese officials have declared it an
illegal, reactionary organization.
   Two of the men _ Huang Han of Canada and Bell M.S. Wong, an
American who also goes by the name Huang Wencheng _ were ordered out
of China and flew to Hong Kong, the official China Daily said today.
   The third man, Tang Guangzhong, flew back to the United States to
continue studies at Utah State University.
   The report said the three acknowledged they were members of the
alliance. It also said they had admitted breaking the law.
   It was not clear why Tang, a Chinese citizen, was allowed to
return to the United States.
   During Yang's trial in 1987, the court said he put up
``reactionary slogans'' at Shanghai's Fudan University on Dec. 22,
1986 and sent letters to students in Canton and Beijing inciting
them to protest.
   Hundreds of thousands of students marched in dozens of cities
during the winter of 1986-87, calling for democracy.
   On Dec. 3, 1987, the U.S. Congress passed an amendment to a State
Department appropriations bill calling for Yang's release, saying he
had broken no Chinese or U.S. laws.
   China called the amendment ``an undisguised interference in
China's internal affairs.''
   Yang's wife, Che Shaoli, lives in Houston and studies
microbiology at the Baylor College of Medicine.
   She said she was thrilled at the news of his release.
   ``But I am sad, too,'' she said. ``I don't know when I will see
him.''

<HEAD>Briton Freed From Iranian Jail Speaks of Experiences</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 23-year-old Briton freed after more than two
years in a Tehran jail claims he was trying to join Afghan
guerrillas when Iranian border guards seized him on the
Iran-Pakistan frontier.
   The Mail on Sunday quoted Nicholas Nicola, who arrived back in
Britain on Dec. 27 after his release, as saying he had been kept
mostly in solitary confinement except for a weekly shower and
interrogation.
   He also confirmed reports that he had been tried, although
because the trial was held in the Farsi language, said he had been
unaware he was serving a 3{-year sentence for possessing weapons,
the newspaper reported.
   Nicola bought a ticket to Pakistan in 1986 in order to join the
Afghan rebels fighting the Soviet-backed Communist government, the
Mail said.
   ``My thoughts were to go and find the mujahedeen (Moslem
guerrillas) ... so I could fight against the Russians,'' the weekly
paper quoted him as saying. Soviets troops have backed Afghanistan's
communist government against the guerrillas in a decade-old conflict.
   Dressed in Afghan clothes and carrying a rifle and pistol he had
bought at a market, Nicola told the paper he was in Pakistan on the
border with Iran when an Iranian patrol began running toward him.
   ``I think they saw my guns,'' he was quoted as saying.
   ``One fired two shots and, without thinking, I fired two shots
into the air with the rifle,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The Iranians beat Nicola, screamed at him and then took him to
prison, he said. After his trial, he remained at Tehran's maximum
security Evin Prison, the report said.
   Nicola said he wasn't sure what to do with his life now, the
paper reported.
   ``I have been too naive,'' he was quoted as saying. ``I had
romantic ideas from the movies. I know it isn't like that now.''
   His release was the latest sign of a thaw in relations between
the countries since they virtually cut diplomatic ties in 1987 after
a dispute which began when British police arrested an Iranian envoy
on shoplifting charges.
   Roger Cooper, a British businessman who has lived in Iran for
more than 20 years, has been jailed there without trial for more
than three years on charges of spying.

stocking that left only small, beaded bits of the anatomy to the
viewer's imagination.

   This normally quiet central Pennsylvania
community of about 7,700 has issued a rather loud eviction notice to
unwanted crows.
   After five days last week of trying to shoo the birds with loud
noise, officials said the number of crow sightings in town markedly
decreased.
   About 35,000 crows were estimated to be in the area at sundown
Friday as a propane gas-fired cannon was being set up to scare them.
The birds soon flew away.
   Police concluded the effort against the birds Saturday morning by
firing off several noisemakers to chase the few crows that had
returned.
   Various kinds of fireworks had been set off since Tuesday to
convince the birds that trees in Milton are unacceptable places for
them to roost at night.
   It remains to be seen whether the crows will return, so residents
have continued their noisemaking to ensure that their unwanted
visitors stay away.

   Byron Pursifull says he's never seen a tree
he didn't like.
   And the 61-year-old building and maintenance supervisor for the
Johnson County Parks and Recreation Department intends to leave his
mark on the county in the form of greenery.
   The founder of the Johnson County Garden Club, Pursifull has
taught schoolchildren to plant crab apple trees and has designed
landscaping and planted trees in the Johnson County Park.
   Pursifull's devotion to tree planting has earned him the
attention of the National Arbor Day Foundation, which plans to honor
him April 29.
   He is one of two people who will receive the Lawrence Enerson
Award, named after a former trustee of the Arbor Day Foundation. The
award honors those whose life work exemplifies commitment to tree
planting and conservation as part of community improvement.
   ``When he's talking, they (children) listen to him and you can
tell in their eyes how interested they are in what he has to say,''
said Don G. Wertz, science coordinator at Custer Baker Middle School
in Franklin, who nominated Pursifull for the award. ``When he talks
about trees, he refers to them as `little fellows.' He's such a nice
gentleman to have around kids.''
   Pursifull's current project: planting trees at the Johnson County
Park to honor anyone who is a county resident.
   ``I sincerely hope future generations will be able to stroll
around this site while they think of loved ones honored with a
living tree,'' he said.

<HEAD>Stocks Dollar, Rise In Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices surged on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
today in the first day of trading after Emperor Hirohito's death,
and the dollar edged higher against the Japanese yen for the third
consecutive session.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected shares, a 25.75-point
gainer Friday, shot up 468.85 points, or 1.5 percent, closing at
30,678.39 points, a record high. The previous record was 30,243.66
last Wednesday.
   It was the largest one-day advance since Jan. 6, 1988.
   Saturday's half-day session of stock trading was canceled after
Emperor Hirohito died of cancer early in the day.
   A dealer at Nomura Securities said small investors were drawn
back into the market after the emperor's death.
   ``During his three-month-long illness, many individual investors
were extremely cautious and anxious about what might happen when the
emperor died,'' said Michio Katsumata. ``But that's over now.''
   Katsumata added that January is traditionally a bullish month for
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and that investors also were responding to
positive economic conditions in Japan.
   Buying interest gradually spread to institutional investors as
prices kept drifting higher through the day, other traders said.
   Dealers said shares were bought on expectations of higher prices
ahead. Many economists have predicted Japan's economy will continue
to boom until the middle of this year, due partly to continuing
domestic demand.
   ``As much as it is discouraged by the death of Hirohito, the
market has high hopes for the beginning of a new era,'' said Koji
Kamemura, head of Yasuda Mutual Insurance Co.'s fund management
division.
   Kamemura said the yen's stability in Tokyo also is providing the
market with more reason for bullish sentiment.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 126.08 yen,
0.11 yen higher than Friday's close of 125.97 yen. It opened at
126.05 yen and traded between 125.85 yen and 126.23 yen.
   The dollar now has gained 2.03 yen in three trading sessions.
   Trading was described as restrained. Some foreign exchange
dealers had anticipated the yen would dip to as low as 129 yen to
the dollar after Hirohito's death.
   An estimated $5.5 billion were exchanged in spot trading today.

   A British investigator offered ``a
wholehearted apology'' for sending the wrong body to a family whose
daughter died aboard the Pan Am jet crash in Lockerbie, Scotland,
the young woman's father says.
   Robert Hunt said he met with a Scotland Yard official Sunday
afternoon at the Hunts' home in the Rochester suburb of Webster. His
20-year-old daughter, Karen, was among the 259 people killed aboard
Flight 103 when it exploded over Lockerbie last month.
   The British police official and an FBI agent spoke to the Hunts
after the Monroe County Medical Examiner's Office determined through
dental records and X-rays Saturday that the remains sent to the
family were not those of Karen Hunt.
   Ms. Hunt, a student at Syracuse University, would have celebrated
her 21st birthday Saturday.
   ``The British official just wanted to apologize,'' Hunt said.
``He offered a wholehearted apology and promised they were doing
everything possible to rectify the situation.''
   ``They really wouldn't commit to anything else,'' he said. ``I
got the feeling they don't want to tell us anything unless they're

   Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem fighters
recaptured villages in south Lebanon today from pro-Iranian rivals.
Police reported ``horrific massacres'' and said at least 80 people
were killed in a 24-hour period.
   The Amal militia claimed its fighters had overrun four of five
villages seized Sunday by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of
God.
   But reporters who drove into the battle zone near Israel's
self-designated ``security zone'' on Lebanon's southern border said
Amal had retaken only three villages. Fierce fighting raged around
the other two.
   Police said at least 80 people had been killed and 200 wounded
since Sunday morning.
   A police spokesman in Sidon said many victims had been hacked to
death.
   ``Others had their throats cut and some were headless. Many were
riddled with bullets,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be named
under standing regulations. ``Horrific massacres have been
committed.''

   Amal claimed its fighters recaptured four of the villages along

   Amal military commanders in Kfar Melki said about 1,000

   Cars hit by rocket-propelled grenades smoldered in the streets of
Kfar Hatta and Kfar Melki, whose 8,000 inhabitants spent the night
when she returned: ``They've burned my house, but God has burned
Hezbolshaitan.'' That's an Arabic pun on Hezbollah's name, meaning
``Party of Satan.''
   Amal and Hezbollah accused each other of ``atrocities and summary
executions'' in the fighting.
   Iran and Syria, Iran's main Arab ally in the 8-year Iran-Iraq
war, have been trying to rein in their feuding Lebanese proxies but
the fighting has raged despite appeals from President Ali Khamenei
of Iran and Syrian leader Hafez Assad.
   In Beirut, Syrian troops with rocket-propelled grenade launchers
patrolled two neighborhoods where Amal and Hezbollah clashed for two
hours Sunday.
   In April, Amal drove Hezbollah fighters from the south in a
four-day battle in which 62 people were killed and 150 wounded.
   Hezbollah retaliated in May, pushing Amal out of most of Beirut's
southern slums, a traditional Shiite stronghold, in a three-week
onslaught. Nearly 300 people were killed and 1,000 wounded.
   The fighting stopped when Syria, whose army controls security in
Moslem west Beirut, sent 4,500 troops into the slums.
   But the bloodletting broke out again in south Beirut in November
and spilled over into west Beirut. Forty people were killed and 87
wounded in six days of clashes.

   A would-be thief got more than he
bargained for when he trired to rob an elderly couple in a motel
room and was tackled by the man, then chased and captured by a crowd
of tourists, police said.
   Michael Lassiter, 33, of Daytona Beach was being held without
bond today in Volusia County Branch Jail on assault and robbery
charges following the Sunday morning incident.
   According to police, Lassiter entered the motel room of Howard
Douglas, 69, of Milwaukee and his wife, Evelyn, and demanded their
money.
   Douglas leaped out of the bathroom and tackled Lassister, police
said. Meanwhile, Mrs. Douglas yelled to a crowd at the pool deck.
She also took off her rings and threw them to a woman by the pool.
   Lassiter, who is 5-11 and 185 pounds, fled after a brief struggle
with Douglas.
   ``I was 5 feet 7 inches tall and 150 pounds, but when you get
near 70, I think you begin to shrink,'' Douglas said later. ``He
looked big when he was coming at me, but he looked a lot smaller
next to the police.''
   Lassiter reportedly headed toward the beach, with a crowd of
tourists _ including the Douglases' 38-year-old son, Craig _ in
pursuit.
   As Kempton Rothpletz, 24, of Dallas left his car to investigate
the commotion, Lassiter leaped into the vehicle and began to drive
off.
   But Lassiter's bad luck continued as Rothpletz jumped back into
the moving car and managed to force it into several parked cars.
Rothpletz suffered scrapes and bruises to his legs when they were
pinned by the car door, police said.
   Lassiter was captured by the group of tourists as he tried to run
away.
   He was charged with strongarm robbery, auto theft, aggravated
assault and burglary. A check showed that he also was wanted for
armed robbery and theft, police said.

   Entering college freshmen are getting less aid
from the federal government and are increasingly interested in
making their educations pay off in cold cash, according to a survey
of more than 300,000 students.
   The annual survey nonetheless found that students entering
college in 1988 were more likely than their 1987 counterparts to
want to pursue graduate study despite the financial obstacles.
   And although students are more interested in making money, they
seem less interested in business careers as a means of reaching that
goal, the survey said.
   At the same time, a record proportion of freshmen reported
themselves feeling frequently depressed. Stress over paying for
college and attaining advanced degrees were possible contributing
factors.
   The findings released Sunday by the American Council on Education
and the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of
California at Los Angeles are based on questionnaires filled out by
308,007 freshmen entering 585 two-and four-year colleges and
universities. The results were adjusted to reflect the total
population of 1.64 million first-time, full-time entering students
and have a margin of error of plus or minus two points.
   Only 15.6 percent of freshmen entering school last fall received
Pell grants, the government's major aid program for low- and
middle-income students, the survey found. That was the lowest level
since the survey began 23 years ago and less than half the 31.5
percent who received Pell grants in 1980.
   Freshman participation in other federal aid programs also fell,
while students reported greater reliance on family contributions,
savings, loans and institutional grants.
   The amount of Pell grant aid awarded to students actually rose
nearly 57 percent from 1980 to 1988, or 17 percent taking inflation
into account, according to The College Board, a New York-based
lobbying group.
   But during the same period, the aid was more sharply aimed at the
very neediest post-secondary students, many of whom shun college in
favor of vocational schools that teach cosmetology, art, drama, auto
mechanics, business skills or other trades.
   Victoria Tripp, an Education Department spokeswoman, said 11
percent of Pell money went to vocational students in 1980, compared
with 27 percent in 1988. ``That figure will increase to one-third in
the early 1990s,'' she predicted. ``The money is targeted to those
students and there has been a proliferation of those schools.''
   Despite the falloff in college aid, a record proportion of
freshmen said they were interested in pursuing advanced degrees _
58.7 percent, compared with 48.3 percent in 1980.
   ``The rising degree aspirations suggest that a growing proportion
of students feel the bachelor's degree will not be an adequate
credential in the job market during the next decade and into the
next century,'' said Kenneth C. Green, associate director of the
survey.
   In line with that, a record 72.6 percent of the freshmen
indicated ``making more money'' was a very important factor in their
decision to attend college. By contrast, the proportion who said
they were going to college ``to gain a general education'' declined
for the 11th straight year, to 60.1 percent.
   Examining personal habits, the survey also found that a 22-year
decline in smoking may be reversing itself. In 1966, 16.6 percent of
opposed to 56.8 percent in 1987).
   Survey director Alexander Astin of UCLA said the survey revealed
including concern about paying for college; increased interest in
   Student interest in teaching rose from 8.1 percent in 1987 to 8.8
for the last 20 years, remained low. Only 5.8 percent of the
freshmen said they planned to pursue science majors, compared with 6
percent in 1987 and 11.5 percent in 1973.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling in Maryland Foster Care Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling that
expands the right of allegedly abused or mistreated foster children
to sue their social workers.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that workers may
be sued for damages under a key federal civil rights law by foster
children in federally funded programs.
   The court rejected an appeal by Maryland social service employees
seeking greater legal protection.
   The Reagan administration joined in urging the court to review a
ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Justice Department
lawyers said the appeals court ruling would expose thousands of
state and local social welfare workers to personal financial
liability for injuries suffered by children in foster homes.
   The government said the appeals court ruling could have even more
far-reaching impact if it is extended to apply to other federally
funded social welfare programs.
   State and local workers who administer Aid for Dependent
Children, Medicaid and food stamp programs also could be exposed to
the risk of big-money damages, the government said.
   The Maryland case stems from a suit against 21 officials,
caseworkers and supervisors who help administer the state's
federally funded foster care program in Baltimore.
   They were sued by children who say they were victims of physical
and sexual abuse and medical neglect.
   A federal judge ordered officials to submit a plan for improving
conditions in foster homes, and for at least monthly monitoring of
the placement of children in the homes.
   The judge also required the officials to improve medical services
for foster children and to report instances of poor medical care to
the children's attorneys.
   The judge also ruled that social workers who place or keep
children in foster homes are not entitled to immunity from lawsuits
in such cases.
   The 4th Circuit court upheld the decision in February 1988.
   The appeals court rejected the social workers' claims that a
federal law providing funds for foster care created no duty on their
part to know whether a child would be exposed to mistreatment or
abuse.
   The appeals court said the social workers' right to claim
immunity from suit must be based on more than their own belief that
they acted properly. It is up to a trial court examining the facts
to decide whether the social workers permitted mistreatment, the
appeals court said.
   The National Association of Social Workers, in supporting the
appeal by the Maryland employees, said the 4th Circuit court ruling
places social workers at risk for alleged abuses that occurred
decades earlier.
   ``No professional consensus exists even now'' on how to assure
foster children will not be harmed, the association said.
``Maltreatment of children in foster homes often is difficult, and
at times impossible, to prevent by even a very highly skilled and
well-trained social worker.''
   The Supreme Court already is studying a related issue in the case
of a Wisconsin boy who suffered severe beatings by his father.
   In that case, the justices are expected to decide whether public
officials may be sued when their alleged gross negligence permits a
child to be abused by a parent.
   Social workers were accused of failing to come to the aid of the
boy even after they had evidence that he was beaten repeatedly.
   The case acted on today focuses on whether a federal civil rights
law enacted after the Civil War permits damage suits based on
alleged violations of a 1980 law, the Adoption Assistance and Child
Welfare Act.
   The 1980 law requires states to meet certain conditions before
receiving federal funds for foster care. The 4th Circuit court said
the 1980 law creates a basis for private citizens to sue if those
conditions allegedly are not met.
   The case is Massinga vs. L.J., 87-1796.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci is asking
Congress to increase defense spending by 2 percent above the rate of
inflation for the next two years in a proposed military budget
likely to change after George Bush becomes president.
   In proposing $315.2 billion in budget authority for 1990, and
$330.89 billion for 1991, Carlucci is requesting an increase in Star
Wars spending authority from $4.1 billion in 1989 to $5.9 billion in
1990 and $7 billion in 1991.
   Under the proposed defense budget for the fiscal year beginning
next Oct. 1, although $315.2 billion would be authorized, $303
billion would actually be spent. The spending authority includes
funding for long-term projects and weapons buying in future years.
The lower figure, outlays, includes only the funds to be spent
during the 12 months of the 1990 fiscal year.
   The $303 billion in 1990 outlays includes Pentagon spending and
$9.2 billion for Energy Department nuclear weapons and research
programs, and is projected at $4.7 billion above actual spending
during this fiscal year.
   Among the requests likely to be changed by Congress or Bush are
$94.6 million in spending authority in 1990 and $124.3 million the
next year for research on a new Navy Anti-Satellite (ASAT) weapon;
and elimination of a proposed single-warhead intercontinental
ballistic missile, the Midgetman.
   In other areas of national security, the Reagan administration is
asking for an increase of $5.6 billion, to a level of $8.4 billion,
in security assistance programs to other nations. The whopping 200
percent jump comes in part because loan repayments from other
nations go down next year.
   The administration is asking for $3.8 billion for grants to
foreign countries _ mostly in the Middle East _ so they can buy U.S.
weapons.
   Another $3.5 billion is being sought in non-military aid, mostly
for Central America and the Middle East. The budget message
forecasts the request of additional money for the Contra guerrillas
of Nicaragua.
   The proposed Pentagon budget also continues production of the
newly unveiled B-2 or stealth bomber, designed to elude enemy radar.
The exact annual cost of that program remains classified, although
the Air Force announced Dec. 16 that each B-2 would cost $516
million, a total of $68.1 billion for 132 planes by 1995, making it
the most expensive plane in the world.
   The B-2 program may face trouble following disclosures of
inadequacies in electronic equipment designed to enable newly
acquired B-1B bombers to penetrate enemy defenses.
   It is also far from clear whether Bush and Congress will agree to
cancel the Midgetman, which would be designed to be fired from
mobile trucks. Last year, the Air Force volunteered to drop the
Midgetman in favor of a rail-mobile version of the 10-warhead MX, or
Peacekeeper.
   The Air Force argued that 500 warheads could be deployed on 50
Peacekeepers for $10 billion vs. $44.7 billion for the Midgetman.
   But Congress restored money for research on Midgetman, arguing
that more missiles would be harder to track and destroy, and that a
single-warhead weapon made more sense under a proposed Strategic
Arms Limitation Treaty limiting the number of launchers.
   Bush was expected to submit a revised version of the budget, and
the retired Air Force general he has named as national security
adviser, Brent Scowcroft, has publicly endorsed the Midgetman over
the MX and has suggested lower levels of funding for Star Wars,
formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   The active duty strength of the armed forces would increase by
5,000 in 1990 to a level of 2,138,300, then decrease the following
year to 2,134,600.
   The force level in the Army and Marine Corps remain the same, at
772,000 for the Army and 197,000 for the Marines, that of the Air
Force would decline slightly, from 571,000 in 1989 and 1990 to
567,000 in 1991, and that of the Navy would grow from 593,000 to

<TEXT>
   A court on Monday convicted a former employee of a
U.S.-run Nazi document center for his role in the theft of thousands
of files from the facility.
   The court sentenced Alfred Darko, former head of the center's
photographic department, to two years and four months in prison.
Three other defendants _ all Germans _ also were convicted and given
suspended sentences.
   Darko, a native of the Ivory Coast, was found guilty of stealing
4,000 Nazi files and selling them to dealers for up to $22,000.
   Chief judge Clemens Basdorf did not order Darko to prison
immediately. Darko, who has spent nine months in investigative
custody and who is reported to be in ill health, was ordered not to
leave West Berlin and to report to police once a week.
   Basdorf said Darko was not the only employee suspected in the
the accomplices,'' Basdorf said.
   More than 10,000 documents are believed to be missing from the
center.
   The Berlin Document Center contains 30 million Nazi files seized
members.
   The thefts were discovered last year.
   Among the documents stolen was the personnel file of former
Gestapo officer Klaus Barbie, known as the Butcher of Lyon, who is
serving a life sentence in France for war crimes.

the documents stolen. Eichmann was executed in Israel after being

   A trial of avowed revolutionaries that
has already cost the government millions of dollars moved toward
opening arguments almost a year after lawyers began selecting jurors.
of the largest manhunts in U.S. history are accused of sedition, or
of the score of bombings the group allegedly plotted from 1976 to
   Up to 350 witnesses could be called. A closed-circuit camera has
been installed with monitors in another room in case defendants are
ejected for unruliness. Observers must pass through two metal
detectors to reach the courtroom, which an estimated 40 marshals
take turns guarding.
   The defendants each face up to 60 years in prison and $60,000 in
fines if convicted on the charges of seditious conspiracy,
racketeering conspiracy and racketeering enterprise.
   Their attorneys argue that the trial is a waste of money because
their clients already have been convicted on bombing and bank
robbery charges and all but one are serving prison sentences. The
cost so far is estimated at well over $3 million.
   The defense attorneys say the seditious conspiracy statute is so
broad that it could be used against protesters blocking streets.
   ``If people engage in political dissent and think this can't
happen to them, they should read the statute,'' said Avenia.
   The statute makes it a crime for ``two or more persons in any
state or territory to conspire to overthrow or put down or destroy
by force the government of the United States.''
   The government has used the statute only a few times since it was
first invoked to punish Confederates during the Civil War, said
Arthur D. Wolf, a professor at Western New England College in
Springfield.
   It was used to keep protesters from hindering the draft during
World War I and to prosecute Puerto Rican nationalists accused in an
assassination attempt against then-President Harry Truman. Last
April, nine white supremacists were acquitted of seditious
conspiracy charges in Arkansas.
   In the case going to trial here, an FBI hunt for the defendants
swept through hundreds of towns in Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Vermont, Connecticut, New York and Ohio in 1983.
   Arrested in their Cleveland house on Nov. 4, 1984, were Jaan
Laaman, 40; his wife, Barbara J. Curzi-Laaman, 31; and Richard
Williams, 41. Agents in Deerfield, Ohio, arrested Raymond Luc
Levasseur, 42, and his wife, Patricia Gros Levasseur, 34, the same
day. Carol A. Manning, 33, and her husband, Thomas Manning, 42, were
apprehended six months later in Norfolk, Va. Christopher King, 38,
was arrested in North Attleboro in 1982.
   The federal trial was moved to Springfield in 1987 so that
defendants could be housed together at a jail in nearby Hartford,
Conn.
   The only defendants, however, are Williams and the Levasseurs.
The five others either have changed their pleas to guilty or been
dropped from the case. Mrs. Levasseur is out on bail, having
finished a five-year term for possessing false identification and
harboring her fugitive husband.
   King was tried separately in 1987. He pleaded guilty that
December to one count of seditious conspiracy and was sentenced to
seven years in prison.
   In August, the government dropped charges against Manning and
Laaman, saying Manning already was serving 53 years and Laaman, 45
years, for bombings. Manning also got a life sentence for the 1981
shooting death of a New Jersey state trooper.
   Mrs. Manning pleaded guilty two weeks ago to all three counts.
She was sentenced to five years, to be served concurrently with her
15-year term on bombing charges.
   On Friday, the First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a decision
suppressing evidence against Mrs. Curzi-Laaman because it was seized
without a search warrant. The decision meant she would be tried
separately. She is serving a 15-year sentence.

   Police in the central Yugoslav
republic of Bosnia have discovered a cache of firearms and
ammunition ``used by terrorists,'' media reports said Monday.
   Authorities in Sarajevo, the republic's capital, said the find
included a U.S.-made automatic rifle, four pistols, eight revolvers
and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, reports said.
   The newspaper, Borba, quoted police as saying the weapons and
ammunition were of the kind ``most often used by terrorists.''
   To date, officials have refused to identify a man detained before
the New Year's holidays on allegations of trying to smuggle the
rifle and four pistols into the country.
   A subsequent search of his home yielded the remaining arms, Borba

   Television portrayals of lawyers as
``aggressive, loud, obnoxious persons who insult judges'' is
ungentle- manly and -womanly, and the Kentucky Bar Association wants
to be sure life doesn't imitate TV.
   The association has decreed that Kentucky's lawyers should be
courteous in the courtroom and friendly with their colleagues and
that the lawyers should never intentionally mislead or deceive their
adversaries.
   The Code of Professional Courtesy, endorsed by the association's
governing board in September, carries no penalties.
   But George Long II, the association's president, said it will
remind lawyers to watch their Ps and Qs.
   Long acknowledged that the law inherently involves conflict. But
he said it should be practiced courteously.
   Richard Frymire, head of the association's Committee on Lawyer
Professionalism, which drafted the code, said it is designed to
counter television portrayals of lawyers as ``aggressive, loud,
obnoxious persons who insult judges'' _ and a growing sense that is
how real lawyers are supposed to behave.
   ``I think it's terrible that a profession like the law has to
have this type of code imposed,'' said Martin Johnstone, the chief
Jefferson Circuit Court judge. ``But from what I've seen over the
past few years, I think it's necessary.''
   Still, some practitioners say the code may clash with more
important ethical requirements, and describe it as vague and even
silly.
   ``Why do we have to be friendly?'' asked Louisville lawyer C.
Thomas Hectus. ``Am I supposed to inquire as to how are the wife and
kids?''
   Writing in the association's magazine, Bench &amp; Bar, U.S. District
Judge William Bertelsman said lawyers have become ``more aggressive
and harder to get along with.'' He said judges must devote
increasing time to refereeing abusive tactics that range from
``benign incivility to outright obstruction.''
   ``I absolutely believe a lawyer can zealously represent clients
and abide by all precepts'' of the code, said Frymire.

   Take his land. Please.
   Robert Luther has 1.2 acres of land, zoned for development, that
he can't sell or even give away. In the meantime, he has to keep
paying taxes that were $1,275 last year.
   The Smithfield resident inherited the parcel in 1985 from his
brother. It is zoned for industry in an area where there has been
considerable recent development. But 80 percent is swampland, and
any alteration for construction requires federal and state consent.
   ``I've had a couple of people look at it, but when they have had
engineers look at it they decided to forget it,'' he said. Two
engineering firms hired by Luther have said the land is unsuitable
for construction in its present state.
   Luther then tried to give it to Providence College, his alma
mater, but they weren't interested.
   So he tried to give it to the town, but the town council isn't
welcoming the offer with open arms either.
   ``You don't look a gift horse in the mouth,'' said Town Council
President Anthony B. Simeone. But the council wants to study the
matter.
   Luther said some have suggested he just stop paying taxes, in
which case the town would seize it and try to recoup the lost taxes
at a tax sale. Luther said he'll wait to hear from the town council

higher than average health risks, and policies are expensive,
costing up to $100 per month for a 65-year-old and more for older
applicants, the report said.
   Many policies restrict benefits for more expensive custodial care
and require prior hospitalization before paying benefits while few
policies protect against inflation, Consumers Union said.
   ``Private insurance is unlikely to be available to people at high
risk and will remain unaffordable by most people,'' the report said.
   But Susan Van Gelder, associate director of policy development
and research at the insurance association, said most policies issued
in the last six months have eliminated many of the restrictions in
the old policies and most now recognize inflation.
   Long-term care, according to the definition used in the Consumers
Union report, is the help ``needed to cope, and sometimes survive,
when physical or mental disabilities impair the capacity to perform
the basic activities of everyday life, such as eating, toileting,
bathing, dressing and moving about.''
   The federal government in 1987 spent about $11.1 billion on care
in skilled nursing facilities and intermediate-care facilities, and
states added $8.9 billion for these services, according to HHS.
Figures for 1988 were not available, the department said.
   Consumers Union said its ``low option'' would cost an additional
$10 billion in federal money, which would be spent primarily to
finance a comprehensive home health care program for people of all
ages. It also would include a voluntary long-term care policy for
nursing home coverage.
   A $20 billion program could include comprehensive home health
care benefits as well as nursing home coverage for the first six
months of care and a voluntary insurance program for long-term
nursing home stays _ a benefits package similar to that proposed by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   The group's $50 billion plan would include the elements of the
previous option with expanded nursing home care benefits.

   Libya's foreign minister said today the United
States has launched ``vile campaigns'' against Libya while helping
Israel build a stockpile of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
   Foreign Minister Jadallah Azouz Ettalhi also said U.S.
allegations Libya has a plant intended to build chemical weapons are
``clearly false.''
   Earlier, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said
evidence shown him by Secretary of State George Shultz did not prove
the U.S. allegations.
   Addressing an international conference on chemical weapons,
Ettalhi said the U.S. position on chemical weapons is discriminatory.
   ``How can any member of the international community proclaim a
right it denies others, and how can it stand in the way of
international efforts at eradicating these weapons while, at the
same time, launching vile campaigns of calumny on the basis of a
discriminatory, racist position, basing itself on accusations which
are clearly false,'' he said.
   The Libyan minister claimed Israel has nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons stockpiles and that the United States provides
financing and technical assistance.
   ``This power (the United States) doesn't hesitate to aggress the
victim. This situation is dangerous,'' Ettalhi said. ``Agreed
international rules must be applied to all parties without
discrimination.''
   The five-day conference, which began Saturday, was called to
bolster flagging talks on a chemical weapons ban.
   The United States and the Soviet Union are the only two countries
to admit possessing chemical weapons. According to U.S. estimates,
about 20 countries possess or have the ability to manufacture
chemical weapons.
   The only existing document on chemical weapons, the 1925 Geneva
Protocol, bans only their use, and without enforcement power, is
regarded as inadequate by many nations.
   Vice Premier Tariq Aziz of Iraq led a move Sunday against a ban
on chemical arms unless nuclear weapons are also banned. He said
Israel has ``nuclear weapons as well as chemical weapons and
missiles that can reach many Arab cities.''
   Israel called the Iraqi statement ``blatant hypocrisy.'' Iraq is
known to have used chemical weapons in its 8-year war with Iran.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Israel today accused Iraq, Libya
and Syria of having chemical arms, telling conference delegates that
these weapons have been used ``by countries that made no attempt to
hide or disguise their hostility to Israel.''
   Shultz met Shevardnadze on Sunday and said he had won a promise
from the Soviets to conduct their own inquiry into the plant at
Rabta, south of Tripoli. He said at the time he believed the Soviets
ultimately would back the U.S.
   Libya has denied its plant can make chemical weapons, claiming it
is intended to produce pharmaceuticals.
   ``The American secretary of state showed me the building plan,
but that proves nothing,'' Shevardnadze told reporters today just
before leaving Paris for Moscow.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
Shultz had given Shevardnadze limited information only to show the
information was ``detailed and serious.''
   ``In response, the foreign minister indicated the Soviets took
these issues seriously and would be looking into it and asking
questions,'' Redman said. ``That's what's important.''
   Shevardnadze told reporters he had told Shultz that ``the most
important thing is to stabilize the situation after the air
incident'' during which American fighters shot down two Libyan
warlanes over the Mediterranean last week.
   On Sunday, the Soviet Union announced it would start destroying
chemical arms stockpiles. U.S. officials said the Soviets were
merely playing ``catch-up'' because the United States has been
routinely destroying stockpiles of aging chemical arms since the
early 1980s.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union will not wait for disarmament
negotiators in Geneva to reach an accord banning use, production and
stockpiling of chemical arms. He said a new Soviet facility to
destroy chemical weapons will go into operation this year.
   The envoy said his country has stopped production of chemical
weapons, an announcement first made in April 1987.
   Lynn Hansen, director ofthe bureau of multilateral affairs at the
U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said the Soviet position
``now corresponds to our own position. ... We simply don't get the
press, because for us it's more routine.
   ``When they do it, all of a sudden it's news,'' Hansen told
reporters.
   The United States halted production of chemical weapons in 1969
but resumed 18 years later to counter the Soviet build-up. The
Soviet Union says it has 50,000 tons of chemical arms stockpiled,

   Soldiers entered a private home in the Armenian
capital Yerevan during a Christmas gathering and arrested 12
activists, including four members of the Karabakh Committee, an
Armenian source said Monday.
   Arpenay Popoyan said in a telephone interview from Yerevan that
the arrests occured Saturday _ Christmas Eve on the Orthodox
Christian calendar.
   Everyone was arrested except the woman who had invited the 12,
she said.
   Four members of the Karabakh Committee, an informal group
agitating for annexation of the Nagorno-Karabakh region from
neighboring Azerbaijan, were arrested along with eight other
Armenian activists.
   Mrs. Popoyan, who is active in the Armenian movement, said that
as of Sunday night, other activists had not yet been able to
determine where they were being held.
   The members of the Karabakh Committee had been in hiding since
some committee members were arrested during President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's visit to the are following the Dec. 7 earthquake.
   They were being held under administrative rules imposed along
with a curfew and military law that allow detention for up to 30
days without formal criminal proceedings.
   Armenians began agitating for annexation of the predominantly
Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region in February. Tension between the
two republics has erupted into violence in which more than 60 people
have been killed, and thousands have fled the violence.
   Azerbaijan and the central government have rejected Armenia's
demand to annex Nagorno-Karabakh.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A filmmaker whose best friend was killed by a
drunken driver turned his grief into a television advertisement that
is a labor of love for a buddy who died a senseless death and the
thousands of others like him.
   ``What we're trying to do is stop people from drinking and
driving,'' Lee Gotfried said Monday. ``We die of enough things in
the world _ disease, famine, war _ I don't think we need this one
... and I think we can do something about this one.''
   Since Christmas week, his public service announcement has been
broadcast nationwide with help from the U.S. Department of
Transportation. The ad has been nominated for a top industry award.
   Gotfriend and his friend, Michael Flax, grew up together on
Chicago's South Side.
   Flax was killed two weeks after his 29th birthday in October
1985. He was crossing the street near Soldier Field after a Bears'
football game when ``suddenly this car came out of nowhere'' and
slammed into him, said Gotfried.
   Flax, who worked for a Chicago trade exchange, died instantly.
   ``He was a good guy, and it was a shame. It's true when they say
the good die young. He was a good one,'' Gotfried, 33, said in a
telephone interview.
   ``That's where the pain is,'' he said. ``He's dead. He's gone. He
doesn't feel anything. The pain is here. And it hurts.''
   Gotfried, who owns a Chicago film production company that makes
commercials, decided to channel his pain and anger into a project
with a special, personal meaning.
   ``I think it's real love,'' said Michael's father, Manny Flax of
suburban Northbrook.
   ``He loved my son so much that he had to do this.''
   Gotfried sent his proposal to an ad council that passed it on to
the Department of Transportation.
   Federal officials sent him a letter last summer saying, ``If you
can get the spot produced, we will assist you in national
distribution,'' Gotfried recalled.
   Insurance companies, soft-drink manufacturers and other groups
turned down his requests for financing, but friends donated about
$75,000 in time, talent and cash. Gotfried pitched in $6,000.
   The ad depicts a trucker whose buddy has just been killed by a
drunken driver. Lonely and depressed, he goes to a diner they used
to frequent. Their pictures hang on a wall.
   Gotfried posed for the photograph of the trucker's friend.
Singer-guitarist Dave Mason, a friend, provided the backround music.
   ``The tag line is, `Please don't drink, then drive,''' Gotfried
said.
   The spot was recently nominated for a Clio award, the advertising
industry's equivalent of an Oscar. Winners will be announced this
spring.

office, said Teeter, who lives in Michigan, did not want to uproot
his family to move to Washington.
   However, Fuller told reporters that Teeter would continue to
serve as a part-time domestic policy adviser to the incoming Bush
administration. ``His advice has been sought for over a decade and
will continue to be sought,'' Fuller said.
   Teeter, who had served as pollster and chief political strategist
for the Bush campaign, had been offered the No. 2 White House staff
job by incoming chief of staff John Sununu.
   Fuller said Teeter made his decision known to both Bush and
Sununu Monday morning.

<HEAD>Reagan Budgets $88.5 Million for Ten Water Projects</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration sought funds Monday
for 10 new flood control and navigation projects, including several
Congress refused to launch last year.
   It requested $88.5 million in its fiscal 1990 budget for the Army
Corps of Engineers projects. Six were in last year's Reagan budget,
but Congress refused to start any. The four new projects are in
Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
   The number of new projects has slumped in recent years under the
pressure of tight budgets and a 1986 law requiring local communities
to put up a share of the initial cost.
   The budget calls for a new system of paying for maintenance on
the Bureau of Reclamation projects, largely bypassing the
congressional appropriations process.
   For the third year in a row, the bureau, which operates in the 17
westernmost states of the lower 48, proposed no new construction.
Sixty percent of the bureau's construction spending would be devoted
to three projects _ the Central Arizona Project, the Central Utah
Project and the Central Valley Project in California.
   The budget calls for no substantial construction money for the
controversial Garrison Diversion Unit in North Dakota until 1994,
though $8.75 million would be earmarked to complete certain
facilities and secure those already built.
   Similarly, the Animas-La Plata Project in Colorado and New Mexico
was allocated only $3.7 million to bring to a ``reasonable
conclusion'' pre-construction activity and equipment purchases.
   The bureau would spend a total of $946 million, down 14 percent
from $1.103 billion this year. Its construction budget would be $655
million, down 7.2 percent from $706 million this year.
   The corps' spending would total $3.2 billion, down 1.7 percent
from $3.26 billion. Its construction spending would total $1.22
billion, up 8.9 percent from $1.12 billion.
   While the 10 new projects would require $85.5 million in start-up
funds, there was no estimate of how much the projects would
ultimately cost.
   Congress must appropriate funds for maintaining the bureau's
projects, including the gigantic dams it runs in the West whose
power is sold by the power marketing administrations of the Energy
Bonneville Power Administration and the Western Area Power
Administration ``will be full partners in approving budgets,
projects and priorities.''
   The budget called for spending $222 million on maintenance, up

in last year's budget requests but were not shown as proposed new
activities.

extending to Horace instead of stopping at West Fargo.

   The Navy said Monday it has selected the

nuclear-powered attack submarine, the SSN-21 Seawolf.

   The Navy expects to award its last two contracts for 688 subs in
fiscal 1990 and then shift production entirely to the Seawolf in
fiscal 1991 by awarding contracts for two subs.
   Now that General Dynamics has won the contract to build the lead
boat, Newport News will not be in a position to compete in the
program until those fiscal 1991 contracts are awarded.
   The Navy expects the new Seawolf to help rebuild the U.S. edge in
underwater warfare _ an advantage eroded over the past decade
because of espionage scandals and Soviet efforts to build quieter
submarines of their own.
   The SSN-21, like the 688-class sub, will be designed primarily to
hunt and kill Soviet submarines. It is supposed to feature greater
speed, better sensors and longer-range weapons than the 688 class.
   The Seawolf ``is going to represent a major advance in speed,
depth, quieting, weapons capability and supportability,'' the Navy
said Monday.

   Fireworks, a 50-gun salute and a flotilla of
ships will mark the 200th anniversary of the inauguration of George
Washington as the first president of the United States, Mayor Edward
I. Koch said Monday.
   The bicentennial celebration will include a re-enactment of
Washington's horse and carriage trip from Mount Vernon, Va., to
lower Manhattan, where he took the oath of office on April 30, 1789.
   ``This is the most appropriate place to celebrate this historic
anniversary, because New York City was the first capital of the
United States under the Constitution,'' Koch said.
   The federal government moved to Philadelphia in 1790 and to
Washington 10 years later.
   The mayor spoke at a news conference in Federal Hall, where
Washington was sworn in.
   Koch invited President-elect George Bush as well as the nation's
past living presidents to attend the inaugural observance on April
29 and 30.
   The events on April 29 will include daylight fireworks and a
parade of 13 Navy and Coast Guard ships representing the original
colonies, followed by nighttime fireworks over the East River.
   There will be an ecumenical service the next day in St. Paul's
Chapel on Lower Broadway, where Washington attended religious
services after his inauguration, followed by the commemorative
ceremony at Federal Hall at noon.
   There also will be a parade up Broadway that afternoon and an
inaugural gala dinner in the evening.
   Estimated cost of the observance, which is being privately
funded, is $1.5 million. So far, more than $1 million in
contributions and pledges has been received.

<TEXT>
   Pakistan will try to mediate between
the Kremlin and Afghan guerrillas, who say they will not continue
talks while Moscow demands a role for Communists in Afghanistan's
future, an official said Monday.
   ``We will try to restart the process,'' a senior Foreign Ministry
official said on condition of anonymity.
   About 3.5 million Afghan refugees live in Pakistan after a decade
of civil war, and Moslem guerrillas use border camps and towns as
bases and supply points. The Soviets have been withdrawing their
soldiers from Afghanistan, and the last 50,000 are to be out by Feb.
15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement.
   Insurgent leaders met twice in Islamabad last Friday with Yuli
Vorontsov, Soviet deputy foreign minister and ambassador to
Afghanistan. But they told a news conference Monday there will be no
more talks until the Kremlin gives up its insistence that the
Communist Party be included in the next government.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, chairman of the seven-party guerrilla
alliance, said further talks were ``futile and give propaganda
material'' to the Soviets.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a Communist coup in April
1978. Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979,
growing to an estimated 115,000 soldiers before the withdrawal began
May 15, 1988.
   Most arms and support for the guerrillas come from the United
States and Pakistan.
   The Pakistani official said the guerrilla alliance had fought the
Communists in Afghanistan ``for all these years and now is not
prepared to give them recognition. We will have to review the whole
thing with the alliance.''
   Vorontosov ended a four-day visit to Pakistan on Saturday, during
which he also met three times with Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub
Khan.
   ``We have impressed upon Vorontsov the importance of recognizing
the realities of the situation and negotiate with'' the guerrillas,
Yaqub Khan said.
   In early December, the Soviet envoy began a diplomatic mission
seeking consensus on a broad-based government for Afghanistan after
the Soviet withdrawal.
   After meetings in Saudi Arabia and Islamabad, the guerrillas
initially agreed to another round. They reversed the decision Monday
after Vorontsov said Moscow would find a way to support its client
regime unless a government including the Communists was in place by
Feb. 15.
   Vorontsov also has met with Afghan guerrillas based in Iran,
Afghanistan's neighbor on the west, and former King Zahir Shah, who
was deposed in 1973 and lives in Rome. About 2 million Afghan
refugees are in Iran.
   Guerrillas based in Pakistan say they will establish a council of
more than 400 members to choose a transitional government to replace
the Communist government in Kabul, which they say is sure to fall
when the Soviets are gone.
   The Pakistani official said refugees will not be forced to return
to Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal is completed, but ``we
hope there will be conditions for them to go home in peace.''

   A 32-year-old businessman was killed Monday when
he slipped and fell to the tracks while trying to board a subway by
climbing between two cars, authorities said.
   About 1,200 passengers had to be evacuated along a narrow catwalk
and through an empty train, and 30,000 commuters were inconvenienced
as service on part of that line was suspended for more than 2{
hours, Transit Authority spokesman Bob Previdi said.
   A 1984 driver's license identified the victi as John Gilmore, 32,
but the address listed did not check out, said Al O'Leary, a Transit
Police spokesman. Police have been unable to locate any relatives
and Gilmore carried no current employer identification, O'Leary
said. The dead man was wearing a suit and tie, his briefcase was
found and he was carrying $194 in cash.
   He apparently was dragged several hundred yards before his body
triggered a brake switch on the underside of each car. When the
train stopped, the motorman got out to investigate and found the
body.
   While rescuers used air bags to lift the subway car and retrieve
the body, about 1,200 passengers had to be evacuated.
   Passengers in a train behind the stopped train were discharged at
the nearest station and the empty train proceeded until it reached
the stopped train.
   Passengers in the stopped train were guided back to the eighth
car, then were led out an open door onto the narrow catwalk in the
tunnel. They were led along the catwalk past the car where the
rescue was under way, then back onto the last car. From there, they
were able to step into the second train, walk the length of that
train, then get back onto the catwalk for the last 50 feet to a
station platform, Previdi said.
   A similar fatality occurred Friday. There were no witnesses in
that instance, but transit officials believe Harry Foy, 27, of
Queens, fell between cars.

to increase cooperation in solving world problems.

   Officials said Monday both engines of a
new Boeing 737 apparently failed, causing the plane to crash beside

   Transport Minister Paul Channon said sabotage was not suspected
in the crash Sunday of the British Midland Airways jet, the second
air disaster in Britain in less than three weeks. Prime Minister

with the crash was suspected.

   Eighty-two passengers and crew members _ all of the survivors of
the crash _ were injured, including 43-year-old pilot Kevin Hunt,
who was hailed as a hero for managing to miss crashing on the
village of Kegworth or the M1 highway.
   The jet, en route from London to Belfast, plowed into a grassy
embankment on the highway Sunday night as the pilot struggled to
make an emergency landing at East Midlands Airport, about 100 miles
north of London. He missed the runway by about half a mile.
   ``So far the evidence, although by no means conclusive, is
consistent with the right engine having stopped before impact and
there are also signs of fire in the left engine,'' Channon told
BBC-TV.
   Asked whether both engines malfunctioned, he replied: ``That
certainly looks probable at the moment.''
   The Boeing 737-400, delivered to British Midland just 12 weeks
ago, had flown less than 500 hours, the airline said. Boeing said
the plane had two CFM-56 engines, built in France by a consortium of
the U.S.-based General Electric Co. and the French company SNECMA.
   SNECMA spokesman Olivier Fagard said he did not know whether both
engines failed.
   ``It is extremely improbable that both engines would break down
in such a short interval,'' Fagard said in Paris. ``We have very
impressive reliability statistics. There ws a fire in engine No. 1,
which was controlled. There was no fire in the other.''
   William Tench, retired head of Britain's Air Accidents
Investigation Board, said the odds against both engines failing on a
Boeing 737 were about 10 million to 1. He suggested there had been a
``technical mistake such as something incorrect being done to the
engines during turnaround (servicing between flights), either
inadvertently or deliberately.''
   Freddie Yetman, spokesman for the British Airline Pilots'
Association, said a double-engine failure was ``astonishing.''
   ``You just don't train for something like this. You work on the
assumption that there will always be an engine working,'' he said.
   Mrs. Thatcher inspected the wreckage of the blue aircraft
crumpled among roadside trees, and visited survivors at Derby Royal
Infirmary.
   Asked whether sabotage was suspected, she replied: ``We rule out
nothing _ we simply can't.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said she ``almost couldn't believe it'' when she
heard about the crash, so soon after a bomb blew apart Pan Am Flight
103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on Dec. 21, killing all 259
people on board and 11 on the ground.
   The Rev. Ian Paisley, the hard-line Northern Ireland Protestant
leader who comforted relatives of the injured on a special flight
from Belfast, also said sabotage should not be ruled out.
   ``It is very suspicious looking because this flight is used by
servicemen,'' he said.
   While soldiers are a frequent target of Irish guerrillas in
Northern Ireland, civilian airliners have never been known to be
attacked.
   Authorities said 25 soldiers stationed in Northern Ireland were
on the flight. Four died, along with at least two Northern Ireland
police officers.
   Investigators searched the wreckage and recovered the flight
recorders Monday. Investigators from Boeing and General Electric
flew here to help in the inquiry.
   Passengers had just been served a light dinner when the plane got
into trouble shortly after leaving London's Heathrow Airport.
   Gareth Jones, 38, said some women passengers wept as the pilot
told them: ``Prepare for a crash landing.''
   As the plane started descending on one engine, Jones said, sparks
began flying from its remaining engine.
   Gilmore Stevenson, 45, told Mrs. Thatcher that it was ``very,
very noisy. ``I'll never forget that noise. We had the sensation of
cartwheeling and I ended up hanging upside-down in my seatbelt. I
was strung up like a turkey.''
   Stevenson said he agonized in the dark over whether to release
his seatbelt and risk being injured when he fell from his seat. By
the time he decided to free himself, he hardly had the strength to
lift his arm to the buckle.
   ``I eventually managed to release the belt and I fell down. It
was only a matter of feet _ I just lay there in a heap.''
   Stevenson said his wife, Vivienne, helped other passengers escape
and he was rescued by firefighters.

<HEAD>Court Allows Defense Lawyers To Strike Blacks From Klan Murder Jury</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARRY MITCHELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOBILE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday allowed
criminal defendants to exclude potential jurors because of their
race, clearing the way for an all-white jury in a case involving a
black man's murder by Ku Klux Klan members.
   The court, over two dissenting votes, rejected arguments by
Alabama prosecutors _ supported by law enforcement officials
nationwide _ that defense lawyers unlawfully are seeking to bar
blacks from a jury in the Klan case in Mobile.
   Justices Byron R. White and Anthony M. Kennedy voted to hear
arguments in the case but four votes are needed to grant such review.
   Mobile County District Attorney Chris Galanos said defense
lawyers should have to follow the same legal guidelines as
prosecutors in not removing potential jurors simply because of the
color of their skin. He also said it's ``absurd'' for defense
lawyers to argue that black jurors cannot be fair to white
defendants.
   But Neil Hanley, a defense attorney in the Klan case, said the
Constitution prohibits ``governmental discrimination'' against
defendants and he was not surprised by the court's action.
   ``I can strike whomever I please (from the jury), based on what's
in the best interest of my client,'' Hanley said. ``I've never
argued that blacks cannot give whites a fair trial.''
   Assistant Alabama Attorney General Ed Carnes said Monday that
Attorney General Don Siegelman instructed him to prepare legislation
that would make it a matter of state law that defense attorneys
could not discriminate on the basis of race.
   Carnes said the Supreme Court, by declining to review the case,
left open the possibility that such a state law may yet pass muster
if the issue reaches the high court again.
   The matter before the high court was whether a 1986 Supreme Court
ruling against racial discrimination in jury selection applies to
defendants as well as prosecutors.
   The court in 1986 ruled that prosecutors may not disqualify
potential jurors based on their race.
   The ruling, which overturned a black man's conviction by an
all-white jury in Kentucky, established that the Constitution's
equal-protection guarantees bar racially motivated jury selection by
prosecutors. But the decision left unanswered whether the same
guarantees apply when defense lawyers seek to mold the racial
make-up of the jury.
   Monday's action involved the case of the March 21, 1981, killing
of Michael Donald, 19, who was abducted from a Mobile street, beaten
to death and his body hanged from a tree.
   Prosecutors said he was the random victim of a Klan hunting party
retaliating for a jury's inability to reach a verdict in the trial
of a black man accused of murdering a white police officer.
   Two Klan members were convicted in the slaying. Henry Francis
Hays was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. James ``Tiger''
Knowles pleaded guilty to a federal charge of violating Donald's
civil rights and was sentenced to life in prison.
   Mobile County prosecutors then charged Hays' father, Bennie Jack
Hays, and Benjamin Franklin Cox with aiding and abetting the murder.
The elder Hays and Cox are former KKK members.
   An all-white jury had been impaneled. The defense attorneys had
disqualified all 16 blacks among 65 prospective jurors. But Bennie
Hays collapsed in court last February, prompting a mistrial for both
defendants.
   Before the retrial, prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court to
test whether blacks may be excluded in a similar fashion again.
   Mobile County Circuit Judge Michael E. Zoghby ruled last May that
``under the law as it now exists, defendants do not have to give a
reason for the exercise of their peremptory challenges.'' The
Alabama Supreme Court refused to disturb the judge's decision.

<HEAD>Lawyer Points To Engine Parts He Says Weren't Tested Properly</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Britain-Crash, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Engines on the Boeing 737 that crashed in England,
killing at least 43 people, had parts that were not properly tested,
said a lawyer who sued the engine's maker four months ago.
   But a spokesman for General Electric Co., which manufactures the
engine in a consortium with the French company SNECMA, said engines
on the plane had checked out as normal.
   Attorney Jim Helmer of Cincinnati, in a telephone interview with
The Associated Press, identified the allegedly faulty parts as timer
valves. He said he didn't know if the parts could have caused Sunday
night's crash.
   ``We have verified that the CFM-56 engines did have timer valves
on them that were produced in Seattle, and that the timer valves
were not produced according to specifications,'' Helmer said.
   A GE spokesman in Cincinnati disputed whether there were any
faulty parts that could have caused the crash.
   ``We've gone back and looked at the records of both engines on
the British Midland plane. And the engines, under tests, performed
normally,'' said Dwight Weber.
   ``This included the aircraft flight acceptance tests. At no time
during these tests did any of these engines display any
characteristics that would indicate malfunction of timer assembly,''
he said.
   ``Also, in a malfunction of a timer assembly, the most extreme
result would be an increase of temperature of the engine exhaust gas
temperature of up to 20 degrees centigrade. That's well within the
operating limits of the engines in question,'' Weber said.
   Helmer's suit was filed in September in U.S. District Court in
Cincinnati but was not unsealed until Friday. It alleges violations
of the False Claims Act and was aimed primarily at military
aircraft, Helmer said.
   The suit alleged that General Electric's airplane engine facility
in Seattle failed to properly test parts until sometime in 1987 when
the testimg program was corrected.
   Helmer told The Associated Press the parts were also used in the
type of engine installed in Boeing 737s.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Jack Gamble declined to
comment on the engine parts.
   The 737-400 model involved in the crash had been delivered to
British Midland Airways 12 weeks ago. It had 500 hours of service.
   Helmer is representing Anthony DiVincenzo, a former plant manger
at General Electric's aircraft division facility in Seattle.
   The False Claims Act allows citizens to sue defense contractors
when contractors receive payments pursuant to falsified standards.
   DiVencenzo maintains through Helmer's suit that General Electric
was required to do certain tests on these parts and that they did
not do the tests or did not do them completely but still certified
they had done the test.
   Helmer said the parts were timer valves. He said he didn't know
what function the parts served but that they were made only at
General Electric's Seattle facility.
   ``We just know they haven't been tested properly,'' Helmer said.

<TEXT>
   Two grenades were hurled into a crowd
attending a basketball award ceremony in the southern Philippines,
and the military said Tuesday the toll stood at 13 dead and up to 89
injured.
   Authorities do not know who was responsible for the Sunday night
attack at a basketball court in Esperanza, a town in the Mindanao
island province of Sultan Kudarat about 600 miles south of Manila,
said Lt. Anselmo Cabingan, a military spokesman.
   About 1,000 people, many of them children, were attending the
basketball tournament when the attack took place, said Sgt. Joven
Astrero of the operations section of the Philippine Constabulary in
Cotabato City, about 40 miles west of Esperanza.
   Astrero said the tournament had just ended and the town mayor,
Romulo Latog Sr., was awarding trophies when the blasts occurred.
Latog and his son, Romulo Jr., were among the injured, Astrero said.
   The government-run Philippines News Agency agency said six of the
dead were children under 9 years of age.
   Such attacks are not uncommon in remote, often lawless areas of
the southern Philippines.
   In another development, the military launched a massive search
for Rizal Alih, leader of Moslem policemen who seized a military
camp in Zamboanga City and killed a general, after officers said he
may have escaped a fierce government counterattack Saturday.
   The military launched attacks after the policemen, who took over
the regional headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary last
Thursday, killed Brig. Gen. Eduardo Batalla and his chief of staff,
Col. Romeo Abendan, who were taken hostage.
   ``We cannot at this time confirm or deny that Alih has escaped
and is presently alive,'' military spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo
said.
   At least 21 people were killed during two days of fighting before
the camp was recaptured. Most of the bodies were burned beyond
recognition when rocket-firing helicopters blasted the headquarters
building Saturday.
   Rose Laurente, a major's wife, said Alih held her and eight other
companions hostage briefly, one day after troops recaptured the camp.
   Military spokesman Col. Anthony Elias disputed the woman's
statement, saying she was a relative of Alih.

<TEXT>
   A Nigerian graduate student who received
financial aid was identified Monday as the holder of last week's $26
million winning Lotto ticket.
   ``My American dream came true,'' Augustin B. Jombo, the second
largest winner of the Lotto, told a news conference.
   A political science student at Fordham University, Jombo, 37,
received a financial aid check of $7,500 Friday, two days after
winning the New York state lottery.
   ``I'm going to call them and say I don't need it,'' he said,
laughing, telling reporters: ``If you call Fordham, they'll tell you
I owe them.''
   He had wanted to be a professor and do research in international
relations, but said, ``I don't think I want to teach now.''
   He chuckled as he recalled how Nigerian friends told him before
he came to the United States in 1980: ``You are going to have some
experiences that are quite unique.''
   Jombo, who has applied for citizenship, said he bought $12 worth
of tickets at a grocery store moments before the 8 p.m. deadline
last Wednesday.
   Jombo has not seen his wife, Grace, and 16-year-old daughter,
Milia, since 1980 and has never seen their 7-year-old daughter,
Tina. He said he had not called them in Lagos, Nigeria, to tell them
of his win.
   ``I'm going to call them today,'' he said. ``They should come
immediately. They should be with me now. I hope to buy them the good
things in life.''
   He will receive 20 annual payments of more than $1.2 million,
minus the 30 percent federal withholding tax required of
non-resident aliens, or about $866,666. The first check is due in
two weeks.

   Investigators today examined the
wreckage of a nearly new Boeing 737 that crashed along England's
main north-south highway after at least one of its engines caught
fire. The death toll climbed to 41.
   British Midland Airways said sabotage was not suspected in the
crash of its jetliner which, bound for Belfast with 126 people
aboard, attempted an emergency landing Sunday night but plowed into
a highway embankment, spilling bodies and personal belongings.
   Nearly 86 people, many with severe injuries, were taken to
hospitals along with the pilot, 25-year veteran Kevin Hunt. One of
the jet's two engines had caught fire 10 minutes into the flight,
but officials gave no immediate explanation for the second disaster
in British skies in less than three weeks.

   At the conference Sunday, the Soviet Union announced it will
start destroying chemical arms stockpiles this year, but U.S.
officials said the Soviets are merely playing ``catch up'' because
the United States has been routinely destroying stockpiles of aging
chemical arms since the early 1980s.
   Delegates from 16 Arab countries at the 150-nation conference
argued, meanwhile, that a total chemical ban would be discriminatory

   The recent discovery of a black widow binary _ a

   The object is a rapidly spinning binary pulsar, a dead, collapsed

   Astronomers have discovered that the pulsar is blasting away its
companion in the last phase of an intricate give and take between
the two distant orbs.

   Always and ever there are things to worry about
regarding the economy's future, and no forecaster seeking to remain
employed would dare not mention them.
   To them, the issuance of warnings is professional protection,
allowing a forecast to be made but escaped from if wrong. Nothing is
lost, since most warnings are considered examples of erudition and
responsibility.
   You should, know, however, that most of last year's warnings _
inflation, dollar collapse, stock market debacle, recession _ were
changed in midstream, only to be trotted out again as the New Year
began.
   This is the 1989 list, with comments by Edward Yardeni, the
   _The Economy Is Overdue For A Recession.
   The expansion has lasted more than six years, a long time by past
but there have been several rolling recessions. Different industries
could happen, but many U.S. companies now operate globally, and bad
may generate inflation.
   ``This could be a big mistake,'' says Yardeni. Why? Because ``in

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The splendid medical technology that saves
countless lives today is also capable of prolonging lives already
lost. It can be a cruel dilemma, but for many terminally ill
patients there's another way: the hospice, an institution of mercy
that has grown by leaps and bounds in the United States. This is the
first of three articles.

   In a fit of depression, when her third
bout with cancer had sounded a death knell, Julia Gebersky inquired
through others whether her son, Robert, had a gun and could shoot.
   Incontinent, her body scarred by bedsores, she had become a
prisoner of her own helplessness. If euthanasia were legal, Bob Gery
said, he would have helped his mother kill herself.
   But there was another way out for Julie Gebersky. Like nearly
200,000 patients a year, she awaited her death in hospice, a way
station for the terminally ill that benignly treats them not for
prolongation of life but to ease their dying and lessen their pain.
   Gery's mother died without much discomfort in the gentle hands of
The Connecticut Hospice, just as his father had died of cancer
nearly 13 years ago under the same hospice care.
   In that span, the number of hospice care programs in the United
States has grown from fewer than 100 to nearly 1,700, according to a
1988 survey by the National Hospice Organization in Arlington, Va.,
which provides technical services for its 900 members.
   While care is much the same, and about 90 percent of it is
provided in the home, the programs are operated by a variety of
organizations. For example, 41.8 percent of the programs are
independently run, 26.6 percent are run by hospitals, 22.4 percent
by agencies that provide care in the home, and 9.2 percent are run
by a coalition of organizations such as nursing homes and hospitals
working together.
   ``Hospice is not a place, it's a program of care,'' says Ira
Bates, vice president of the National Hospice Organization. ``We are
the only health care provider that defines the unit of care as both
the patient and the family.''
   Hospice does this by sending in a team, including volunteers and
social workers, to help the family with housework and personal
problems, to maintain the vigil while they take a break and to help
with funeral arrangements once the patient dies. After that, hospice
workers keep in touch with the family for at least a year to comfort
them.
   Many hospice programs are based in office buildings and lease
beds from hospitals and nursing homes. ``If there is a crisis in the
family, then we can provide continuous home care in the home
around-the-clock,'' Bates says. ``If that's not enough, then we can
move the patient to an inpatient setting.''
   The modern hospice system originated in England in 1967, when
Cicely Saunders, a British physician, founded St. Christopher's
Hospice.
   What brought it about, say hospice authorities, was the leap in
technical advances in medicine since the mid-1950s and the
increasingly common dilemma of terminally ill patients being kept
alive, sometimes against their wishes and the wishes of their
families, at high costs in suffering and financial sacrifice.
   Even some of those dealt the cruelest of hands in life, AIDS
victims who are not only dying but are homeless, find refuge in some
hospices like The Connecticut Hopsice, the first and oldest in the
United States and a leader in care for the terminally ill in the
past two decades.
   Connecticut Hospice began caring for the dying in their homes in
March 1974 and opened a 44-bed hospice for inpatients in July 1980
in Branford. Two years ago, it bought an adjoining home and
converted it into a cottage with five beds for the dying who have no
home or no one to care for them.
   Bates says Connecticut Hospice is unique in its much higher
proportion of inpatient care to home care. It serves as a teaching
hospice as well.
   The average hospice, says Bates, has three or four beds, a paid
staff of eight and 50 volunteers, dealing with about 110 patients a
year. The discharge rate is around 10 percent, those who decide to
seek treatment or who go into remission.
   While hospice patients are mostly elderly cancer victims, as much
as 90 percent, the '80s have brought a new challenge, a younger
generation afflicted with AIDS, either cast aside by society or in
self-imposed exile to keep loved ones from seeing them at their
worst.
   The latest data available from the National Hospice Organization
show hospices served about 2,100 AIDS victims in 1986, among 154,700
patients in all. While later figures are not available, Bates
estimates the number of AIDS victims cared for will reach 6,000 or
7,000.
   Among them are men like Keith Jackson, 27, and Eddie Muniz, 36,
who found accommodations in The Connecticut Hospice cottage last
year, their gaunt bodies implanted with catheters, their shoulders
propped up by hospice volunteers and friends so they could walk,
their lips barely movable, slurring their speech almost as if they'd
suffered a stroke, and coughing, coughing, coughing.
   ``I got a home but I don't want to be near the girls because I've
been sick,'' Muniz, an admitted drug dealer and user and the father
of three daughters, ages 8, 10 and 12, told a visitor last November.
``I know I'm gone. I don't want to go...'' He paused. ``Yet.''
   Jackson, a fashion model who is gay, lived with his divorced
mother until she died two years ago. He said he would rather live in
the cottage than move in with his father or siblings. ``This is my
home,'' he said.
   Nurses, the heart of hospice care, and volunteers, the soul, give
the men medication, feed them, do their laundry and take them out to
dinner and to shop. Like many of the terminally ill, they dread
above all dying alone, in confusion and fear. The hospices quietly
ease those apprehensions.

   For ``sundowners,'' who fear the night and sleep by day, families
are often bedded down by their bedsides in inpatient hospices like
The Connecticut Hospice, which has its own building. Other hospices
operate in a wing or ward of hospitals.
   ``One of the big complaints is that dying is so sterile,'' says
Pat Jones, executive vice president of the Hospice Association of
America, a Washington lobby group that represents 1,300 hospices.
``People were isolated in a hospital room, maybe the family couldn't
come in. I think it's related to the need to be in control of one's
life. I don't think it's an accident that hospice started coming
into being around the same time as home birth. It's taking dying
back into the family, into the home.''
   Indeed, says National Hospice's Bates. ``Most people want to die
at home. Ninety-eight percent will say, `I want to be at home with
enough of hospitals and doctors and that there was little else

<HEAD>AIDS Fear Leads To Clotting Factor Shortage For Hemophiliacs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Perhaps the best thing that ever happened to 20,000
Americans with the bleeding disease hemophilia was the discovery of
treatment with a protein called factor VIII. It was also probably
   Five-minute infusions of this natural substance overcome their
have given more than half of them AIDS infections.
   ``In the New York region, we've used 30 to 40 percent less
clotting factor'' in 1988, said Dr. Richard Lipton of Long Island
Jewish Medical Center. ``I don't know if I can say anyone has died
because of this, but we have had some pretty hairy situations trying
to find factor VIII for people who are bleeding.''
   Doctors say that because of the shortage, most non-emergency
surgery has been postponed for hemophiliacs. Bleeding often is
treated with less than the recommended doses, sometimes with poor
results. Users have smaller reserves for emergencies. Most have
stopped taking preventive doses and now use clotting factor only for
actual bleeding.
   They also have had to rely more on cryoprecipitate, an older,
less convenient therapy that requires a trip to the hospital to
receive blood plasma that is rich in factor VIII. This treatment
carries the same very slight risk of AIDS as an ordinary blood
transfusion.
   The shortage ``has produced a tremendous amount of frustration,
and in some people despair, in some anger and in some resignation,''
said Donald S. Goldman, a lawyer from West Orange, N.J., who has
hemophilia.
   Hemophiliacs represent just 1 percent of the 80,000 AIDS cases
reported in the United States since 1982. However, a larger
proportion of them are infected than are the other two major risk
groups, homosexual men and drug addicts.
   About 60 percent of U.S. hemophiliacs are infected, and for those
with the most severe form of the disease it's perhaps 80 percent to
90 percent, said Alan Brownstein, executive director of the National
Hemophilia Foundation.
   While most of the hemophiliacs who carry the AIDS virus are still
healthy, doctors fear that many of them will eventually get AIDS.
   Hemophilia is caused by a genetic defect passed from mothers to
sons at conception. Victims don't produce enough factor VIII, one
link in the chemical chain reaction that prompts the body to stop
bleeding. Without treatment, cuts may bleed for days, but the most
common problem is bleeding internally. Bleeding into the joints
causes crippling deformities.
   Once, the only treatment for hemophilia was blood transfusions.
Then blood plasma was substituted. In the 1960s, cryoprecipitate
became the standard. Finally, in the 1970s, factor VIII became
available. Instead of 30 to 50 trips a year to a hospital for
infusions, people with severe cases could quickly treat themselves
at work or at home.
   ``We are talking about people who, aside from the horrible AIDS
tragedy, have been liberated by clotting factor,'' said Brownstein.
``A person with hemophilia can do any job now. If they have a
spontaneous bleeding episode, they can mix their preparations and
infuse themselves on the spot. They can do it as conveniently in a
747 as in their own living room.''
   Factor VIII is derived from human blood. It takes about 30 liters
to produce enough clotting factor for one treatment. In commercial
production, blood plasma from many people is mixed together. A
single dose may contain elements of blood from 20,000 people or more.
   No one knew it at the time, but during late 1970s and early
1980s, AIDS virus in the donated blood passed through the
purification process into the factor VIII. In 1982, the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control reported the first three suspected cases of AIDS
among hemophiliacs.
   In 1984, manufacturers began heating the clotting factor in an
effort to kill HIV, the AIDS virus, and a year later, a test became
available to screen donated blood for the virus. Since then, factor
VIII makers have adopted other cleansing techniques, including
detergents and antibodies.
   Since 1985, only 18 new AIDS infections have been documented,
said Brownstein, who believes the latest strategies have made
clotting factor HIV-free. But they have also made it expensive and
scarce. The new processes yield only about half as much factor VIII
per liter as the earlier techniques.
   Robert W. Reilly, president of the American Blood Resources
Association, an industry group, said the price has risen six- to
seven-fold since 1985. Enough clotting factor for one person now
typically costs about $50,000 a year, Brownstein said.
   The price and supply were also affected by low demand for
albumin. Until recently, factor VIII was simply a by-product of the
business of producing albumin, which was used to restore blood
volume after surgery and burns. However, albumin is being replaced
by newer treatments.
   Factor VII was already in short supply at the start of 1988. But
the situation became much worse because of problems at the American
Red Cross, which produces about 20 percent of the country's clotting
factor.
   Last April, the Red Cross discovered it had allowed factor VIII
to be made from blood that should have been discarded because of
potential AIDS contamination. Dr. S. Gerald Sandler, vice president
for blood services, said that most of this was from people whose
blood twice tested positive for HIV during initial screening but was
shown by later confirmatory tests to be safe.

   For the second time in two years, Congress has

taxpayers will find the new version more advantageous but they also
will be able to deduct less consumer interest.

   First lady Nancy Reagan was saluted Monday night
for her sense of style and her contribution to the American fashion
industry.
   Mrs. Reagan was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by
the Council of Fashion Designers of America at its eighth annual
awards ceremony, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
   ``There are many pluses and minuses to being in the White House.
One of the pluses is trying to help an industry that is one of the
most important in our country and I think the American fashion
designers are the best,'' said the first lady, who was wearing a
brilliant red floor-length gown designed by Oscar de la Renta.
   ``And when I found myself in the position to make others aware of
that, or at least try to, I was delighted to do so,'' she added.
   Broadcaster Barbara Walters, in presenting the award to Mrs.
Reagan, said the first lady and the president, during his eight
years in office, ``gave us pride, gave us hope, gave us style ...
that intriguing, all-encompassing word that says so much. Style.
Presence. A sense of beauty. ... Nancy Reagan has style.''
   Prior to the awards ceremony, de la Renta, president of the
council, said of Mrs. Reagan: ``I think she put American fashion on
the pedestal where it belongs and brought elegance back to American
fashion.''
   Designer Donna Karan said of Mrs. Reagan: ``The contribution to
fashion she has made goes beyond her clothing to her sense of
sophistication, caring and elegance as first lady of the United
States.''
   Calvin Klein, accompanied by his wife Kelly, said: ``She has
shown how women can look so well-groomed, so attractive and so
American.''
   Mrs. Reagan has been criticized for borrowing much of her
high-priced wardrobe while living at the White House _ a practice
critics said amounted to free advertising for the designers whose
clothes she wore.
   But Ms. Walters said she thought a first lady should be
``encouraged to borrow'' because it ``stimulates American industry.''
   Her comment caused the 500 ceremony guests to applaud vigorously.
   Mrs. Reagan had worn the de la Renta gown she wore to the
ceremony on at least three other occasions, said Wendy Toler, a
spokeswoman for the first lady.
   Also among those recognized at the ceremony was designer Geoffrey
Beene, who was saluted for making ``fashion as art.''
   Performer Liza Minelli, one of many women attending the ceremony
who dressed in Mrs. Reagan's favorite color, red, presented the
Perry Ellis award for new fashion talent to Isaac Mizrahi, whom she
called ``a brilliant and startling talent.''
   Ms. Minelli wore a floor-length gown with a leg-revealing slit
designed by Mizrahi.
   Actress Audrey Hepburn, wearing a red gown designed by Givenchy,
presented a Lifetime Achievement Award to photographer Richard
Avedon, for his ``pictorial contribution to American fashion and his
photographic reportage of historical events.''
   Bill Robinson received the award for menswear design. Nina Hyde,
fashion editor of The Washington Post, was recognized for her
reporting on American fashion.
   Karl Lagerfeld, designer for the house of Chanel, received a
special award for his international fashion influence.
   Grace Mirabella, former editor-in-chief of Vogue magazine, was
recognized for her promotion of American fashion in the media.
   Judith Peabody, a member of the board of directors of the Gay
Men's Health Crisis Inc., received the council's special
humanitarian award.

<HEAD>Former Nazi Propagandist Seeks Refuge In Canada</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former Yale University lecturer who was
stripped of his American citizenship in 1986 for his role as a Nazi
propagandist in the Soviet Union during World War II has asked for
refugee status in Canada, a report said Monday.
   Vladimir Sokolov disappeared in July when he was scheduled to
appear at a deportation hearing in Hartford, Conn.
   His whereabouts were unknown until he applied for refugee status
in Montreal sometime before Jan. 1, claiming that his life would be
in danger if he was forced to return to the Soviet Union, the
Canadian Broadcast Corp. reported.
   No date has been set for an immigration hearing, the report said.
   From 1942 to 1944, Sokolov was a writer and editor of a Russian
language newspaper published by the German army in his hometown of
Orel, 220 miles south of Moscow. Anti-Semitic articles appeared
under his name, although he has maintained that the most offensive
tracts were written by Nazi censors.
   His Canadian lawyer, Julius Grey, said Sokolov faces almost
certain death if deported to the Soviet Union.
   ``The Soviet press has been gloating over his return and have
called him a traitor,'' Grey said. ``He would likely be put to death
or given a lengthy sentence. For all practical purposes it would be
the end of his life.''
   Grey, a noted constitutional lawyer who is also defending
convicted murderer John Joseph Kindler from extradition to the
United States where he faces the death penalty, said the 75-year-old
Sokolov is in very poor health.
   Sokolov failed to reveal his wartime activities in 1951 when he
entered the United States as a displaced person. He became a citizen
in 1957 and two years later began lecturing on Russian language and
Soviet dissident literature at Yale.
   His past was uncovered by the Yale student paper in 1976 and he
later resigned. But the U.S. government waited until 1982 before
filing a complaint to strip him of his American citizenship.

   Four former Ku Klux Klan members entered
guilty pleas in federal court Monday for their part in a violent
clash in 1979 with black marchers.
   The four were the last of nine former Klan members who were
indicted and eventually pleaded guilty to federal charges stemming
from the gunfire in a Decatur parade that wounded several people.
   There were no fatal injuries in the 1979 confrontation. The
wounded included police officers.
   Two of the former Klansmen _ Ray Winford Steele and William
Riccio _ pleaded guilty Monday to a felony count of obstruction of
justice and a misdemeanor count of conspiring to violate civil
rights.
   The other two _ William Johnny Mason and Lynwood White _ pleaded
guilty to the misdemeanor conspiracy count.
   The former Klansmen were accused of blocking a Southern Christian
Leadership Conference march on May 26, 1979. The marchers were
protesting the prosecution of a mentally retarded black man charged
with the rape of a white woman in Decatur.
   The misdemeanor conspiracy count carries a maximum sentence of
one year in prison and a $1,000 fine. The felony count carries a
maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   U.S. District Judge John Hancock delayed sentencing for up to a
month.

<HEAD>1986 Tax Reform Benefits Farmers When Income Grows, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department analyst says the 1986
tax reforms can mean substantial savings to farmers when incomes
rise but that the old federal rules allowed bigger breaks as
earnings decline.
   Clifford V. Rossi of the department's Economic Research Service
said the Tax Reform Act of 1986 can reduce overall tax liability for
farmers by an average of 4.5 percent from previous levels.
   Rossi used a computer model and information from more than 15,000
federal tax returns of ``farm sole proprietorships'' for 1982 to
come up with the estimates. His findings were in a new staff report
circulated by the agency.
   Farm sole proprietorships were defined as ``self-employed
individuals filing a Schedule F federal tax form,'' which is the
basic paperwork required of farmers by the Internal Revenue Service.
   ``In general, lower marginal tax rates and generous expensing
provisions will offset repeal of the investment tax credit and
capital gains preference,'' the report said. ``Taxpayers with high
off-farm incomes receive little benefit from the new law.''
   Rossi noted that farm incomes can vary greatly because of
weather, economic conditions and other factors. So he performed a
``sensitivity analysis'' that includes a 25 percent increase and
another that includes a 25 percent decrease on farm income.
   The increase in net farm income resulted in a 10.9 percent
increase in federal tax liability under the old rules and only an
8.3 percent increase under the 1985 law, he said.
   By contrast, Rossi showed that a 25 percent drop in income would
result in a decline of 8.7 percent in taxes under the old federal
system and only 7.7 percent less under the new reforms.
   ``In terms of net winners and losers from tax reform, taxpayers
engaged in field crop and general livestock operations benefit more
from the new tax laws than other farm groups,'' he said. ``All
sectors, with the exception of the dairy sector, experience net
reductions in tax liabilities under tax reform.''
   Rossi said dairy farmers suffer under the new tax law ``because
of low taxable incomes that consequently cannot offset the loss of
capital gains preference'' and investment tax credit, two of the
major writeoffs under the old law.
   ``Farm enterprises with relatively high capital intensities are
burdened more by the loss of certain preferences for capital
intensities than other farm operations,'' he said. ``There is also
some evidence that more generous expensing and depreciation
provisions are of greater consequence to capital-intensive
operations than other farm types.''
   Rossi said the 1986 law ``tends to reduce tax burdens for
taxpayers with low and moderate levels of income'' and that those
whose taxable incomes were more than $500,000 showed the smallest
decline in taxes.
   According to Rossi, the new study is ``the only comprehensive
assessment of tax liability in the agricultural sector'' and will
aid in future policy considerations.
   ``If history is any indicator of future activity in tax policy,
the Tax Reform Act of 1986 will undergo refinement or overhaul in
the years ahead with accompanying effects on agriculture,'' he said.

   Tokyo continues to be the most expensive world
capital for groceries, according to the Agriculture Department.
   A 16-city survey by the department's Foreign Agricultural Service
in November showed that a retail market basket of selected food
items cost more than $144 in Tokyo, while the lowest cost was in
Brasilia at $27. In Washington, D.C., the same items were about $53.
   In order, the 16 capitals and market basket costs included:
Tokyo, $144.10; Stockholm, $99.92; Bern, $96.62; Seoul, $63.25;
Madrid, $59.64; Paris, $56.89; Rome, $58.64; London, $55.63;
Washington, D.C., $53.26; Bonn, $51.59; Canberra, $49.77; Ottawa,
$49.41; Buenos Aires, $40.99; Mexico City, $31.94; Pretoria, $31.17;
and Brasilia, $27.08.
   The agency said the food items ``reflect purchases more typical
of U.S. consumers rather than those of other nations'' and that
caution should be used in making comparisons. Differences in
quality, packaging and seasonal variations in supply were cited.
   Among the items, sirloin steak was shown at $10.71 per kilogram,
or about $4.87 per pound, in Washington, D.C., and $57.06 per
kilogram, or $26 per pound in Tokyo. In Brasilia, sirloin was $2.75
per kilo, or $1.25 per pound.
   The comparisons were begun by USDA many years ago to bolster
claims that Americans pay lower prices for food than many other
people in the world.

   Rising food prices in China may help spur
greater interest in imported U.S. farm commodities, according to an
Agriculture Department trade report.
   ``The combination of rising incomes, inflation fears and the
expression of pent-up consumer demand for almost everything has
created a sellers' market for most agricultural goods as well,''
according to the report in the January issue of Ag Exporter magazine.
   Higher prices for grain, livestock and dairy products are
expected to encourage imports of breeding animals, feed grains,
soybeans and meal, and wheat and wheat flour, the report said.

   One of every three men and women walking down
the aisle in the United States has been married before, but the
remarriage rate for divorced Americans has been declining, according
to a National Center for Health Statistics report.
   The government report also shows that most divorced men marry
divorced women and that of those divorced Americans remarrying in
1983, the women were on the average 34 years old and the men, an
average 37 years old.
   The report is based on samples of records from states that
compile marriage and divorce statistics. It studies data collected
from 1970 to 1983, the latest year for which most of the figures
were available.
   The number of remarriages increased during the period studied,
rising from 404,000 in 1970 to 736,000 in 1983 for divorced women
and from 423,000 to 773,000 over the 14-year period for divorced men.
   But although the number of remarriages was growing over those
years, the pool of divorced men and women was growing faster, the
report said.
   In 1983, the remarriage rate for divorced women was 91.6 per
1,000 compared with 123.3 per 1,000 in 1970. The rate for divorced
men was 142.1 per 1,000 compared with 204.5 per 1,000 in 1970, the
report said.
   ``Thus, only 9 percent of divorced women and 14 percent of
divorced men remarried in 1983, compared with 12 percent of divorced
women and 20 percent of divorced men in 1970,'' the report said.
   The figures also show that most women marry men of the same
marital status. In 1983, the report said, 55 percent of all women
and men who married were both single, 19 percent were both divorced
and 2 percent were both widowed.
   Men traditionally are older than the women they marry, and this
generally holds true for remarriages as well as first marriages,
according to the study. The only combinations in which that trend is
broken is for divorced and widowed women who marry single men. In
1983, widowed women were an average 2 years older and divorced women
were an average 1 year older than the single men they married.
   Many of the patterns for first marriages don't hold up for second
and subsequent marriages, the report noted.
   While more than three-quarters of first marriages are performed
in religious settings, the proportion drops to about 60 percent for
marriages involving divorced men and women.
   Also, first marriages have a typical seasonal pattern _ many more
are performed in the summer than in the winter, the report said. But
second and subsequent marriages tend to be spread more evenly
throughout the year.

   Two employees of a McDonald's Restaurant
were fatally shot during a robbery Sunday and a suspect was arrested
hours later at a Wilmington, Del., bus station, officials said.
   Robert P. Hughes IV, 21, of Glen Mills, was arrested at about
8:40 a.m., said Wilmington police Sgt. Richard Andress. Hughes was
charged with resisting arrest, carrying a concealed deadly weapon
and was held as a fugitive, Andress said.
   In Pennsylvania, Hughes was charged with two counts of murder,
two counts of criminal homicide, robbery and weapons violations,
said James P. MacElree II, Chester County district attorney.
   Extradition proceedings probably will begin this week, Andress
said.
   Restaurant manager Jean Reider, 41, of Newark, Del., and Charles
Hegarty, 46, of West Chester, were killed in the holdup, which
occurred before the restaurant had opened, police said.

<TEXT>
   Fear that the U.S. government will go it alone
in world trade is discouraging other countries from joining in an
accord that could cut spending on farmers by tens of billions of
dollars every year, according to a report published by the
International Monetary Fund.
   Fund experts see a possibility that James M. Baker III,
designated as secretary of state by President-elect Bush, will
single out favored countries as trading partners instead of
promoting U.S. trade with the whole world.
   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, whose
members include the governments of the major industrial countries,
says farm subsidies cost consumers and taxpayers $185 billion a year
between 1984 and 1986. The biggest costs are in the United States,
western Europe and Japan.
   The IMF report cites a speech last year by Baker, then secretary
of the treasury. Baker spoke of what the U.S. government would do if
there were a failure of the trade talks now being held by
representatives of 96 countries.
   ``We might be willing to explore a `market liberalization club'
approach, through mini-lateral arrangements or a series of bilateral
agreements,'' Bush was quoted as saying.
   Bilateral agreements are like the new one between the United
States and Canada, freeing up trade between two countries but
tending to freeze out others. A similar deal with Israel was made
earlier last year. A ``mini-lateral'' arrangement includes not just
two but a group of countries, like the 12 in the European Economic
Community.
   Groups of this kind encourage trade among members at the expense
of those outside the club.
   The report was written before last month's meeting in Montreal of
representatives from the 96 governments. They agreed on how to
negotiate 11 different kinds of trade issues in the remaining two
years of talks. But they failed to agree on four others, including
agriculture.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter insisted that other
governments, especially the Europeans, promise to join in a
long-term phase-out of subsidies before he would talk about cutting
them in the immediate future. Bush has picked Yeutter as his
secretary of agriculture.
   On Thursday Alan Holmer, Yeutter's deputy as trade
representative, said he was optimistic about agreement being reached
on farm issues by April, a new deadline set at Montreal. But
negotiations are being soured by a fight between the European
community and the Reagan administration over the hormones that U.S.
farmers use to make their cattle grow faster.
   Last Sunday the community, which tries to keep its own farmers
from using hormones, banned imports of U.S. beef and veal worth over
$100 million a year. The Reagan administration retaliated with
increases of 100 percent in import duties on such items as Danish
hams and sun-dried tomatoes from Italy, a measure designed to make
them too expensive for Americans to want to buy. The Europeans are
threatening a counter-reprisal and U.S. officials say they have a
list ready should that happen.
   A truce is in effect at least until Jan. 23, when ministers of
foreign affairs from the 12 countries are due to meet in Brussels.
Bush will have been inaugurated three days earlier and the new
administration may have some ideas for getting the talks back on the
rails. Yeutter is to be replaced as trade representative by Carla
Hills.
   The report published by the International Monetary Fund is called
``Issues and Developments in International Trade Policy.'' It was
written by a team under Margaret Kelly, an Australian who heads the
fund's Trade and Payments Division.
   The fund is owned by 151 countries, with the United States
holding the biggest block of votes.

<TEXT>
   General Douglas MacArthur and others directing
the occupation of Japan after World War II resisted powerful U.S.
and allied opposition in keeping the late Emperor Hirohito on the
chrysanthemum throne, where he reigned for another 43 years.
   The emperor's prosecution for war crimes, execution, imprisonment
or exile was favored by 70 percent of Americans in a public opinion
poll seven weeks before the end of the war. Some allied governments
had similar views.
   MacArthur, supreme commander of the U.S. occupation of Japan, was
the best known of those resisting demands for punishing the monarch
who died in Tokyo Saturday at the age of 87 after a 62-year reign
marked by military expansion, crushing defeat, reconciliation,
dramatic economic growth and new heights of prosperity and prestige
for his country.
   Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and six other Japanese officials were
convicted and hanged as a result of the Tokyo war crimes trials.
Tojo's testimony at one point threatened to implicate the emperor in
whose name the militarists had overrun East Asia.
   Documents released in Washington 25 years ago by the State
Department show that MacArthur and other U.S. officials decided
retention of Hirohito was vital to maintaining order in the former
enemy country and carrying out their mission of democratic reform.
   But those planning Japan's future were also aware that the
emotions of war had generated powerful sentiment in America and
other allied countries for prosecuting and ousting the mikado as
responsible for aggression and atrocities of the imperial military
command, the documents showed.
   George Gallup, director of the American Institute of Public
Opinion, declared June 23, 1945, that ``the average American''
thinks Hirohito ``should be treated like any other war criminal.''
   In his latest Gallup poll, he said, 33 percent of those
questioned said Hirohito should be executed, 17 percent said ``let
the court decide his fate,'' 11 percent said ``keep him in prison
the rest of his life'' and 9 percent wanted to exile him. Only 4
percent favored ignoring him as a mere figurehead, 3 percent said
``use him as a puppet to run Japan.'' Other replies or no opinion
accounted for 23 percent.
   MacArthur wrote in his memoirs that Hirohito had already been
stricken from the list of potential war crimes defendants when the
monarch first visited him Sept. 30, 1945. Hands trembling, the
emperor offered to bear sole responsibility for the war, MacArthur
wrote, adding that, ``I knew I faced the First Gentleman of Japan in
his Own Right.''
   Four months later, the five-star general messaged Washington that
Hirohito's indictment and execution could trigger a convulsion,
potential chaos and guerrilla warfare in Japan. One million
occupation troops might be needed and ``all hope of introducing
democratic methods would disappear,'' MacArthur said.
   George Atcheson Jr., MacArthur's State Department adviser, told
Truman in 1946: ``There is no question that the emperor is most
useful. He is obeyed ... he manifests sincerity in wishing to aid in
the accomplishment of our general objectives and is seemingly more
anxious to be democratic than some of the people around him.''
   A specialist strongly advocating retention of the emperor was
Hugh Borton, member of the U.S. State-War-Navy coordinating
committee in Washington that began studies before the end of the war
on occupation policy and sent its findings to MacArthur.
   Reached at his home in Conway, Mass., Borton, now 83, said the
committee favored keeping Hirohito on the basis of expert opinion
that ``he was one who could more influence the Japanese populace
than anyone else, and the important thing for the United States was
to make the occupation as effective as possible rather than a
continuation of the war.''
   First indications, in August 1945, that the emperor might be
retained produced a strong but mixed reaction in Congress. Sen. Tom
Stewart D-Tenn., said the emperor is ``a war criminal and I'd like
to see him hung up by his toes.''
   Sen. William Langer, R-N.D., said the emperor ``ought to be
treated like Hitler.''
   Sen. Richard Russell, D-Ga., who later introduced an unsuccessful
resolution urging trial of the emperor, called anything less than
unconditional surrender ``a terrible mistake.''
   But Sens. Styles Bridges, R-N.H., Elbert Thomas, D-Utah, and
Robert Taft, R-Ohio, said it should be possible to deal sternly and
effectively with Japan and simplify military operations by working
through the emperor.

   President Reagan's submission today of his
$1.15 trillion federal budget for fiscal 1990 triggers a work
schedule that is specified by law, cited with reverence by lawmakers
and then routinely ignored.
   This year should be no different.
   The law calls for Congress to have completed work on the spending
plan by April 15. In addition, all 13 appropriations bills that
finance the federal government are supposed to be in place by the
Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year.
   But that rarely happens, and ingredients for delay abound this
year.
   Congress will be treating Reagan's proposal as largely
inconsequential and waiting for a new plan from President-elect Bush
after his inauguration. The House Budget Committee isn't even
planning any hearings on Reagan's blueprint and will wait instead
until it receives something from Bush.
   In addition, Bush's repeated pledges to avoid new taxes puts him
in direct conflict with many congressional leaders who say the
additional revenues will be unavoidable.
   ``There probably hasn't been a year in the last five where the
likelihood of keeping to the budget schedule is less likely,'' says
Stanley E. Collender, the Washington-based director of federal
budget policy for the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse.
   This hasn't stopped top members of Congress from their usual
pledges to move quickly on the budget.
   Last Monday, Congress' first day in session, House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, set a goal of meeting budget deadlines and said,
``So far as the speaker can influence the schedule, we shall perform
our work on time.''
   And new Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn.,
expressed the same desire in a telephone interview last week, adding
that the delay caused by the presidential transition ``doesn't waive
the provisions of the law'' setting the budget work schedule.
   But history shows that fiscal and political crises, not
timetables, govern the budget process.
   Budget deadlines set by law come and go with no real consequences
if they are missed.
   But three key fiscal events are scheduled to occur roughly
simultaneously this fall and are likely to spur action in what
Collender, borrowing from the language of New Age adherents, calls
``the political equivalent of the harmonic convergence.''
   Sometime this August or September, the government is expected to
reach its debt ceiling of $2.8 trillion, meaning that legislation
will be needed for it to be able to borrow more money.
   At the same time, if there is no budget agreement between
Congress and the White House, the mechanism will begin that
ultimately triggers the dreaded automatic spending slashes required
under the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. Those cuts _ which are
seen by most people as draconian _ would take effect Oct. 1.
   In addition, September is the last month of the fiscal year. Some
sort of legislation that provides money must be in place by Oct. 1
or the government cannot function.
   Stalemates are common when it comes to the budget because the
blueprint is the most basic statement of the government's
priorities. It not only perpetually creates institutional struggles
between the executive and legislative branches, but it is a
battleground for Democrats and Republicans positioning themselves
for future elections.
   Last year was unusual for its budget harmony because most of the
crucial decisions were made at a summit among Reagan administration
officials and congressional leaders shortly after the October 1987
stock market crash. It was the first year in 12 in which all 13
spending bills were finished by Oct. 1.
   In 1987, spending legislation was not completed until nearly
Christmas, three months into the fiscal year.

   Prince Charles has angered British farmers by
linking intensive farming methods with erosion and the destruction
of wildlife.
   ``People are becoming increasingly concerned about the damage to
the environment arising from the application by farmers of the
principle of the maximization of production,'' he said in an address
to an organic food production conference this weekend.
   ``It is increasingly felt by members of the public that
large-scale soil erosion, the destruction of wildlife habitat and
the excessive use of chemicals and unnatural substances are
unacceptable and cannot continue without ruining the countryside for
future generations and probably causing long-term health hazards.''
   National Farmers' Union President Simon Gourlay said the prince
had ``gone over the top in sounding the alarm bells and I do not
think he's justified in saying there's a buildup of long-term
environmental problems.''
   Charles has shown a penchant for voicing public concerns, most
notably in the field of urban development and architecture.

   Shoes have put former U.S. Rep. John
Jenrette back in the news.
   The South Carolina Democrat, who was convicted in 1980 in the
FBI's Abscam investigation, faces charges of petty larceny for the
theft of a pair of shoes and for altering price tags at a suburban
Washington, D.C., department store, authorities said.
   He is scheduled to go to trial in Fairfax County, Va., on Feb. 1,
said his lawyer, Warren McLain.
   ``It was a silly, silly mistake,'' Jenrette said Saturday, adding
that if he hadn't lost his temper over the Dec. 7 incident, the
arrest ``probably wouldn't have happened.''
   Jenrette said he was trying on a pair of rubber work shoes at the
store when he heard that cars parked outside were being towed. He
said he walked outside with the shoes on because he thought he had
parked his car in a ``questionable area.''
   Two security guards immediately ``jumped on me,'' Jenrette said.
An argument ensued and ``the next thing I knew they signed a
warrant.''
   Jenrette also denied charges that he altered prices on a pair of
pants and a shirt from a clearance table.
   Following Abscam, his former wife, Rita, appeared seminude in
Playboy. She wrote a book about how she and Jenrette made love at
the U.S. Capitol and how she found $25,000 stuffed in his brown
suede shoe.

   Thirteen-year-old Drew Barrymore, the lovable
little girl in the movie ``E.T.,'' said agents hired by her mother
put her in handcuffs to take her back to the hospital after her
binge of substance abuse.
   In September, she said, she took a break from her initial
hospital stay for drug and alcohol use to audition for a play in New
York, and broke her 88-day string of sobriety when she snorted
cocaine in a nightclub restroom.
   She said she then stole her mother's credit card, flew to Los
Angeles, snorting more cocaine, and went on a shopping spree.
   Her mother hired private agents who handcuffed her and sent her
back to the hospital, according to her first-person account in this
week's People magazine.
   She said her descent into drug and alcohol abuse began with her
rise in fame. ``From the time I became famous in `E.T.,' my life got
really weird,'' Miss Barrymore said.
   Miss Barrymore was released from her second stay at a
drug-and-alcohol rehabilitation hospital shortly before Christmas.
She said she drank at age 9, smoked marijuana at 10 and snorted
cocaine at 12.
   ``It was frightening. I was this 7-year-old who was expected to
be going on a mature 29,'' she said. ``By the time I was 8{, I felt
like I was some abnormal, crazy girl. I could walk up to the door of
any nightclub and they'd say, `Hi, you're that little girl. Come
in.'''
   Last June, after a beer binge, Miss Barrymore had a showdown with
her mother and ``started throwing things _ glasses, vases. They were
breaking all over the floor. I went from party girl to jerk of the
planet.''

   Singer Chuck Berry thinks the nondescript terra
cotta building at 2120 S. Michigan Ave. should take its rightful
place as a historic location in the development of urban blues.
   ``I recorded some of my biggest hits at that address,'' Berry
recalled recently. ``I have a lot of memories of it. They were great
days of great music.''
   The building once was the mecca for the nation's blues musicians
_ the home of Chess Records. This week, the Commission on Chicago
Landmarks will consider the nomination of the two-story building for
city landmark status.
   During the 1950s and 1960s, passersby might have seen Howlin'
Wolf, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, the Dells, or the Rev. C.L. Franklin
and his daughter, Aretha.
   Bluesman Willie Dixon said he would like to make the building the
national headquarters for his Blues Heaven Foundation, which raises
money for music scholarships, and perhaps a blues museum.
   ``It is part of the history of America,'' Dixon said. ``Remember,
all rock is the blues by rearrangement. And the blues should have a
place, a home, so the world knows where they came from.''

<HEAD>Town Looks To City-Owned Utility For Lower Electric Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCH WEISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLYDE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city manager is on the verge of flipping a
switch that will send electricity flowing through city-owned power
lines, a change he says will save money for residents of this
northern Ohio town.
   But officials for the Toledo Edison Co., which now supplies
electricity to the town's 5,600 residents, say a municipal power
system will be unreliable and electric rates will eventually
increase and surpass their rates.
   City Manager Nelson Summit admits that the Clyde Light and Power
Co. is a gamble.
   ``What it boiled down to was I felt there was a better way to
provide electricity. It turned out that it is going to be cheaper
and rates will get a lot better in the future,'' Summit said in a
recent interview.
   But Toledo Edison is putting up a fight.
   It filed a lawsuit last month after the city refused to start
negotiating the renewal of the private company's franchise to serve
the city. The contract expires in June 1990.
   Toledo Edison wants to force Clyde to explain to the state Public
Utilities Commission why the company should not be allowed to
compete with the new municipal system in Clyde, about 30 miles
southeast of Toledo.
   Toledo Edison will lose about $7 million to $8 million annually
in revenues if the franchise is not renewed, said Mark Everhart,
general manager of the utility's eastern district.
   The utility has 275,000 customers in northwestern Ohio. ``Losing
Clyde is kind of like cutting the heart out of a distribution
system,'' he said.
   The conversion to a city-owned system had its beginnings five
years ago when Summit moved to Clyde and saw his electric bills
double.
   Voters in November 1987 approved a $10 million bond issue to set
up the utility company. Early last year, the city agreed to buy
power wholesale from the Canton-based Ohio Power Co. at 3.1 cents
per kilowatt hour.
   The city wanted to buy Toledo Edison's distribution system, but
the company's selling price of $30 million was too high, Summit said.
   Now, Clyde is building a new substation, distribution and
transmission lines. Its first customer, a Whirlpool Corp. plant, is
expected to be on line in early March, Summit said.
   The City Council recently set rates for the new system at 7 cents
per kilowatt hour. The current rate is 9.5 cents and the average
household pays $52 a month. That's expected to drop to $39.
   More than 80 Ohio communities have municipal electric systems,
most buying power wholesale from utilities, but no municipal system
has been set up since the early 1900s.
   Clyde's operation is being closely watched by other Ohio
municipalities interested in cutting electric rates.
   ``There is no doubt about it, a precedent has already been set
and Toledo Edison is worried,'' Summit said.
   But there are several inherent problems with municipal power
systems, Everhart said. In coming years, some cities may have
trouble buying power wholesale because supplies will diminish, the
utility company official said.
   ``A no-frill utility company will work fine until the wind blows
hard, until there is a major accident and until something goes
wrong. And then all of a sudden, you are left holding the bag,''
said Everhart.

   A Belfast-bound jetliner carrying 126
people crashed beside a highway in central England on Sunday and
broke into pieces, killing at least 37 people and injuring 76,
officials said.
   The airline said the crash was caused by engine failure and ruled
out sabotage.
   The British Midland Airways Boeing 737-400 was en route from
London's Heathrow Airport to Northern Ireland when it developed
engine trouble, the Civil Aviation Authority said.
   The jet attempted to land at East Midlands Airport near
Nottingham, about 100 miles north of London, but undershot the
runway by a half-mile and crashed alongside a highway, smashed into
an embankment and broke apart, police said.
   Witnesses reported seeing an engine in flames as the aircraft
came in low, dropping bits of debris and shearing off treetops as it
careened toward the highway. Cars swerved to avoid the hulk and
there were a few minor injuries from auto collisions, police said.
   ``We believe that 37 people have died as a result of this
accident, but there are still some people in the wreckage,''
Leicestershire Assistant Chief Constable Tony Butler told a news
conference.
   He said he did not know whether the trapped people were dead or
alive. It was also not certain that all 37 were aboard the plane,
since police reported there may have been casualties in cars on the
highway.
   After nearly eight hours of rescue efforts at the edge of
England's busiest north-south highway, one of the people aboard was
still trapped alive in the wreckage and two bodies awaited recovery,
the Leicestershire Ambulance Service said.
   Police in the county of Derbyshire reported several bodies
scattered on each side of the highway. Two nearby hospitals reported
a total of 76 people injured.
   ``All of them seemed to have smashed ankles and legs, and with a
lot, their faces were badly damaged too,'' said Joe Weston-Webb, 50,
who lives in the nearby village of Sutton Bonningale and was among
the first on the scene. He helped rescue several people and saw many
bodies in the wreckage.
   ``It seems a miracle that any one got out alive though, and I
can't believe that it all didn't go up in flames. It was
horrendous.''
   The plane, a new aircraft that only had been in service for three
months, was carrying 118 passengers and eight crew, the airline said.
   The crash was the second major air tragedy in Britain in three
weeks. On Dec. 21, a Pan Am Boeing 747 bound for New York blew up
over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on
the ground. That jet had also left Heathrow. A bomb was blamed for
the crash.
   The flight Sunday took off from Heathrow Airport at 7:52 p.m. and
its engine caught fire 10 minutes later, the Department of Transport
said.
   The pilot told the control tower he had the engine fire under
control, but when the plane was still one to two miles out, ``it was
clear that there would be an accident,'' airport official Michael
Cowan told a news conference.
   `As the plane approached the control tower it was apparent it was
too low,'' he said.
   Airline executive Colin Roberts told relatives at Belfast
Airport, ``There was absolutely no question of sabotage and there
was nothing to indicate that whatsoever.''
   The accident was caused by a technical fault in one of the
engines of the new plane, which had made seven flights on the
London-Belfast route, he said. The weather was reported good.
   The 737 crashed at about 8:30 p.m. (3:30 p.m. EST) about a mile
outside the village of Kegworth, Inspector Neville Cotterill of the
Leicestershire police said.
   The tail section as embedded in the ground and the fuselage broke
into several parts spread over fields, Cotterill told The Associated
Press.
   But he added that no cars were known to have been hit as the
plane thundered alongside the M1, England's main north-south highway.
   The highway was closed as dozens of ambulances and fire engines
converged on the scene. Cries for help could be heard from inside
the fuselage. Personal belongings littered the highway.
   Rescuers dug steps into the embankment and formed a human chain
from the wreckage to the ambulances. They flattened trees and hacked
open the fuselage.
   The cockpit with a large chunk of fuselage came to rest in thick
brambles and trees near the top of the embankment.
   The pilot, Capt. Kevin Hunt, was hospitalized with multiple
injuries, British Midland said.
   A local vicar, the Rev. Michael Brandon, said he held a
passenger's hand and whispered the Lord's Prayer to him as he died.
   ``It was very dignified and peaceful. There is not a lot more you
can do in a situation like this,'' he said.
   The crippled jet roared over 16-year-old Samantha Phelby's house
just before it hit the ground.
   ``We looked outside as it got louder and as it was going overhead
we saw the left engine still on fire. Then we heard this pop, which
could have been the crash. Then we heard the fire engines,'' she
told Independent Radio News.
   Desmond Anderson, who lives 400 yards from the airport's main
runway, said, `The far side engine was on fire, backfiring and
roaring away ...
   An Automobile Association manager, John McKnight, said: ``There
are still people trapped and work is going on to free them. From the
reports I have had there is a terrific amount of wreckage. It's a
hell of a mess.''
   British Midland chairman Michael Bishop said said the pilot
reported ``severe vibrations in one of the engines'' and asked
clearance for an emergency landing at the airport.
   Bishop said the company had taken delivery of the plane only 12
weeks ago.
   Civil Aviation Authority spokeswoman Ann Noonan said the pilot
reported problems in his No. 2 engine and was having trouble
climbing. The two-engined aircraft disappeared off ground control
radar screens at 8:15 p.m.
   The Boeing 737-400 is a version of the Boeing 737 with a longer
fuselage and can carry 146 passengers. It was introduced last year.

   Political parties are struggling to emerge in
this British colony but face the formidable hurdles of apathy,
public distrust and a wary Communist China, which gains sovereignty
over the territory in 1997.
   Attempts to form the groups comes as Britain prepares to hold
Hong Kong's first general legislative elections and China appears to
have reluctantly dropped its opposition to such activity.
   The organizations will be different from Western-style political
parties because they will not be able to form a sovereign
government. Instead, they will be limited to trying to influence the
outgoing British rulers and pursuing whatever local power Beijing
permits under the ``high degree of autonomy'' it promises for this
capitalist enclave after 1997.
   ``The administration of Hong Kong will be in the hands of Hong
Kong people, so in that sense we still have a lot of power,'' said
Yeung Sum, chairman of Meeting Point, a pressure group of about 300
members that views itself as a future party.
   In recent weeks, businessman Stephen Cheong and lawyer Martin
Lee, both members of the colony's Legislative Council, have
announced plans to form political parties. Councilor Maria Tam's
Progressive Hong Kong Society also is mentioned as an emerging party.
   Those groups are expected to participate in general elections to
be held in 1991 for 10 of 56 seats on the council, which is
primarily a forum to debate policy made by the British governor and
his advisers. The council now consists of government officials,
government appointees and representatives of interest groups and
local advisory boards.
   The 1991 elections ``will be run on party lines, I'm quite
sure,'' said Joseph Y.S. Cheng, a political scientist at the Chinese
University of Hong Kong. But the groups will face huge problems in
gathering support from Hong Kong's 5.7 million people, who
traditionally distrust political parties.
   Families who fled to the coastal enclave blame China's myriad
20th century woes on both the Communists and Nationalists, who moved
to Taiwan after the 1949 revolution. Both parties operate
unofficially in Hong Kong.
   ``People in Hong Kong feel very comfortable with the status quo,
and they are afraid of political activities, political
confrontation,'' Cheng said.
   Yeung acknowledged that Meeting Point had not clearly declared
itself a political party for so long because ``all through the
years, people (have been) skeptical of the label.'' Cheong rejects
the ``party'' label for his new group.
   Political scientist Peter Harris of the University of Hong Kong
believes the groups will have trouble winning broad backing. He said
``the mass of the Hong Kong people are more interested ... in
getting the kids to school. Their understanding of issues is still
in a very inchoate stage.''
   Attempts by civic leaders three years ago to form political
parties stalled not from apathy but because of China's opposition,
according to Lee.
   That stance appears to have softened, however, with the onset of
legislative elections that China has promised will continue after
1997.
   Xu Jiatun, China's main representative in Hong Kong, said early
this month that the new constitution being drafted for the territory
effectively allows political parties.
   Many of the emerging political groups have not clearly stated an
ideology and may be identified primarily by the personality of their
leaders. Some of those leaders may seek to become Hong Kong's first
chief executive, which will be the top local post after the British
leave.
   Cheong said his group will call for stability and only gradual
political change, while Lee is the territory's most vocal advocate
of sweeping democratic reform. Three-year-old Meeting Point's goals
include a high degree of self administration for the territory after
1997, a central social security fund and more education subsidies,
Yeung said.
   Lee believes the major issue dividing the parties will be whether
they speak primarily for Beijing or Hong Kong interests.
   One big question is whether the Chinese Communist Party in Hong
Kong, which now works behind the scenes, will go above ground to
openly participate in elections.
   ``That would frighten the industrialists away, immediately,''
said Lee.
   Despite the growing activity of local political groups, Harris
sees little hope for them to wield real power, noting that
authoritarian Communist countries such as China do not accept
challenges to their rule.

   An earthquake with a preliminary reading of 5.1 on
the Richter scale shook a small island south of Tokyo today, the
Central Meteorological Agency said. There were no immediate reports
of damage or injuries.
   The tremor, which occurred at 12:15 p.m. (10:15 p.m. EST Sunday),
was centered at about 12 miles under the seabed south of Miyake
Island, about 100 miles south of Tokyo, the agency said.
   It said another undersea earthquake of lesser magnitude hit the
same area 36 minutes earlier. No magnitude was available for the
first quake.
   The island is home to 4,300 people.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its
epicenter, according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale is considered ``very
strong,'' a reading of 6 means ``severe,'' and capable of widespread
damage near the epicenter.

   They were lukewarm about the Declaration
of Independence and the Constitution. They opposed the War of 1812.
And in presidential elections they voted against their neighbor,
John Kennedy, and their governor, Michael Dukakis.
   The people of this Cape Cod community have never gone with the
flow and they show no signs of changing as they celebrate
Barnstable's 350th anniversary this year.
   ``I hate to use the cliche Yankee independence, but I suspect
there is an aspect of that,'' said Patricia Duffy, who has been
helping compile a lengthy history of the town for use in the school
curriculum. ``We are cautious. We don't jump on any bandwagons.''
   Barnstable lives in the shadow of its neighbors Hyannis and
Hyannisport, made famous by the Kennedy clan.
   But Hyannis and Hyannisport are not officially incorporated as
towns; they are merely two of seven villages in the town of
Barnstable, which occupies the midsection of the cape.
   Barnstable is the principal municipality of Barnstable County,
which encompasses all of Cape Cod. It's the state's third largest
community geographically and has a year-round population of about
35,000 that doubles during summer.
   But few outside New England know its name, although residents
hope to change that with a 12-month celebration that promises much
variety, if little peace and quiet.
   Festivities include a summer rowing regatta, a colonial costume
day, a publishing party for the Cape Cod Almanac, and a Boston Pops
concert on the Hyannis town green.
   The big celebration comes in early September, the actual
anniversary month, and includes a visit by a delegation from
Barnstable's namesake, Barnstable, England.
   The events the town will commemorate began in September 1639,
when Barnstable was incorporated under a land grant from the Plimoth
Colony.
   The town history describes reaction to the American Revolution as
mixed, with wealthy Tories quarreling with patriots over British
domination. John Crocker, whose ancestors were among the town's
first 45 inhabitants, puts it in physical terms: ``In the Crocker
Tavern (still standing) there is a gouge out of one of the beams
where a couple of fellows had a sword fight over the issue.''
   The town neither endorsed nor opposed the Declaration of
Independence. A town meeting initially voted against the U.S.
Constitution because it lacked a bill of rights.
   ``The people were more wealthy down here and they were tending
toward the status quo,'' said Robert O'Leary, a social studies
teacher.
   Early thriving industries included cranberry harvesting, which
survives to this day, shipbuilding, lumbering, oystering and
extraction of salt from the ocean. Today tourism dominates.
   Because of the importance of sea trade to Barnstable, the
townspeople opposed the War of 1812 against Britain. This time there
was no give to their position: Isaiah L. Green, the area's U.S.
representative, voted for the declaration of war and lost his seat,
according to the school department history.
   Residents remember the Kennedy era fondly. They speak of John F.
Kennedy parading through town after his Democratic presidential
nomination, and of his victory speech in Hyannis after the 1960
election.
   But at the polls, residents favored Richard Nixon by 4,515 to
2,783. They had no greater favorite-son feelings last year, when
George Bush beat Dukakis 10,026 to 9,971.
   Joseph Kennedy brought his family to Hyannisport in 1926 but it
wasn't until his son became a national figure that the sandy beaches
and sunshine of Cape Cod gained national attention and later
unrestrained development, say local historians.
   ``The beauty, uniqueness and excitement of the cape portrayed by
the press put Barnstable on the map and in the world spotlight,''
according to the school department narrative.
   Cape Codders regret some of the growth, as they showed last fall
when they supported a non-binding resolution in favor of a building
moratorium. Former U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas, a Cape Cod summer
resident, said the problems on Cape Cod are as much aesthetic as
environmental.
   ``Much of what has been built on Route 28 in Hyannis is
schlock,'' Tsongas said. ``If the development that took place was
architecturally consistent with the cape, it would not have been
half as offensive as it is.''

<HEAD>Applications To Nursing Schools On Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of students entering nursing school
jumped 11 percent last year because of higher salaries and a healthy
job market, according to the magazine that surveyed more than 220
schools.
   The increase follows a nearly a one-third drop from 1983 to 1987.
   Schools responding to the annual survey, to be published today by
the trade magazine Nursingworld Journal, had a total of 15,494
freshmen in 1988, up from 13,970 in 1987.
   ``Probably the most important thing is that there has been so
much publicity about the national shortage of nurses,'' Publisher
Richard A. DeVito, said Friday.
   But a more troubling factor, DeVito said, is that many schools
have reduced entry level grade point averages to attract more
applicants. Perhaps as a result, he said, graduate nurses failed
their licensing exams at a record rate of 16 percent in 1988, four
times the 1987 level.
   The journal said it sent its survey to 1,491 U.S. nursing schools
and received responses from 227 institutions in 44 states.
   Hospital officials hailed the finding as good news for the
nation's health care system, which has been strained by a
``significant and persistent shortage'' of nurses, according to a
December report by the Commission on Nursing of the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services.
   About 300,000 nursing jobs were unfilled nationwide, the American
Nurses Association estimated last year.
   DeVito said the shortage has had a direct impact on wages,
pushing up starting salaries for registered nurses by an average of
$5,000 to $6,000 during the last five years. Registered nurses now
typically start at $22,000 to $28,000 a year, depending on region,
and experienced nurses earn up to $55,000 in some cities, he said.
   According to the survey, licensed practical nursing programs
experienced the greatest increase in beginning students in 1988,
with a 25.4 percent jump. Hospital-based diploma programs were next,
with a 14.6 percent rise.
   Baccalaureate programs at four-year colleges and universities saw
a 10.7 percent increase. The smallest change was in associate degree
programs offered by two-year junior colleges, which reported 8.7
percent more freshmen.
   DeVito cautioned that because of the decline in entrance
requirements, the overall increase of 11 percent may not necessarily
translate into an 11 percent rise in the number of graduates.
   ``The problem it's going to create is that while we have roughly
a big increase in freshman enrollees, they've lowered the admission
standards, so we may have fewer people who are going to be able to
make the grade,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews Nov. 10-20 with 1,084 adults in the
continental United States. The phone numbers were selected randomly
by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the
most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult
American were asked the same questions the results theoretically
would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19 of 20 times. The
error margin is larger for subgroups _ 4 points for women, for
example, and 5 for Democrats.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. In your opinion, how serious a problem is homelessness in the
United States? Is it very serious, fairly serious, not too serious,
or not serious at all? Very: 68 percent. Fairly: 24. Not too: 5. Not
at all: 1. Don't Know or No Answer: 2.
   2. Do you think the problem of homelessness is getting worse,
improving, or staying about the same? Worse: 68. Improving: 3. Same:
24. DK-NA: 5.
   3. Who do you think should be primarily responsible for helping
homeless people _ the federal government, state government, local
government or private charities? Federal: 32. State: 24. Local: 18.
Charity: 9. DK-NA: 17.
   4. Do you think federal spending on helping the homeless should
be increased, decreased or remain the same? Increased: 60.
Decreased: 6. Same: 27. DK-NA: 7.
   a. (If increased) Would you be willing to pay more taxes for
that? Yes: 86. No: 11. DK-NA: 3.
   5. Thinking about why most people are homeless, would you say
society is mainly at fault, or the homeless personally are mainly at
fault? Society: 45. Homeless: 33. DK-NA: 22.
   6. Do you think homelessness is a problem only in big cities, or
in communities of all sizes? Cities: 24. All sizes: 74. DK-NA: 2.
   7. Does the federal government do enough to prevent people from
becoming homeless, or not? Yes: 27. No: 58. DK-NA: 15.
   8. Should the federal government build more subsidized housing
for poor people? Yes: 65. No: 27. DK-NA: 8.
   9. How about people who are homeless _ should the federal
government spend more to provide them with housing? Yes: 62. No: 27.

<HEAD>Attorney General Says Administration Did Not Try To Thwart Walsh
Inquiry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the
Reagan administration did not try to thwart independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh from pursuing his investigation of the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Thornburgh said Sunday that Walsh had assured him before dropping
two key charges against Oliver North that he had been dealt with
``in good faith'' and had gotten ``full cooperation from the
intelligence community.''
   Thornburgh's comments on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley'' came after questions of whether he realized his
administration's decision to withhold some classified evidence on
national security grounds would force the prosecutor to drop some
charges against the fired National Security Council aide.
   The attorney general said he himself was concerned about any
impression ``there was some kind of cover-up or stonewalling of the
independent counsel's office.''
   In a meeting Wednesday, the day before Walsh moved to drop the
charges, Thornburgh said he asked for Walsh's personal assurance
``that he had been able to follow every line of inquiry that was
available, that he had had full cooperation from the intelligence
community, and that ... everyone he dealt with had acted in good
faith.''
   Walsh ``had no hesitation in satisfying my concerns on that
score,'' said Thornburgh. Walsh has not commented publicly on the
matter.
   Thornburgh said it was ``inherent'' that if the documents were
withheld, it ``would have an eroding effect on the quality of the
government's case'' against North. But ``the decision was Judge
Walsh's.''
   Thornburgh said that apart from revealing national security
secrets, a criminal trial on the original charges probably would not
have revealed anything ``that would surprise anybody'' in light of
the Tower Commission report and congressional investigation of the
Iran-Contra affair.
   North is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 31 on a dozen remaining
felony counts, including obstruction of congressional and
presidential inquiries, false statements to Congress and improperly
converting travelers checks belonging to the Nicaraguan Contras to
his own use.

   Americans generally agree that homelessness is
widespread and worsening, and most are dissatisfied with the
government's response and would be willing to pay more taxes to
combat the problem, a poll has found.
   A plurality of the 1,084 adults surveyed in the Media
General-Associated Press poll primarily faulted society rather than
the homeless for homelessness.
   A plurality also said the federal government is chiefly
responsible for solutions.
   The poll exhibited the broad reach of homelessness: Six in 10
said homeless people were in their communities, and three-quarters
said the problem plagues communities of all sizes, not just big
cities.
   Accordingly, respondents rated the problem as extraordinarily
severe. Sixty-eight percent called it ``very serious'' and 24
percent said ``fairly serious.'' The remainder gave it less
importance.
   The national poll, conducted by telephone among a random sample
of adults Nov. 10-20, had a 3-point margin of error. It was
completed before winter's cold increased attention on the homeless.
   Still, nearly seven in 10 respondents said homelessness was
getting worse, a quarter said it was unchanged, and 3 percent saw
improvement. The remainder had no opinion.
   Views were divided on the responsibility for solutions.
Thirty-two percent said the federal government was primarily
responsible; 24 percent said state governments, 18 percent said
local governments and 9 percent said private charities. The rest had
no answer.
   Wherever prime responsibility lies, only 27 percent said the
federal government was doing enough to prevent people from becoming
homeless, and 58 percent said it was not. The remaining 15 percent
had no opinion.
   A solid 60 percent said federal spending on programs for the
homeless should be increased, and 86 percent of that group said they
would be willing to pay higher taxes for that purpose. That totaled
52 percent overall, an unusually high level of acquiescence to
higher taxes.
   On specific programs, 62 percent said the federal government
should spend more on housing for the homeless, and as many favored
the preventive measure of building more federally subsidized housing
for the poor.
   In virtually all these measures, homelessness was seen as severe
and worsening by a greater share of women, Democrats, liberals,
minorities and younger people. They also were more apt to blame
society and to favor a greater federal response.
   Seventy-eight percent of women rated the problem as ``very
serious,'' compared with 56 percent of men, for example.
Eighty-three percent of Democrats said it was getting worse,
compared with 54 percent of Republicans. And sixty-four percent of
liberals said society was at fault, compared with 37 percent of
conservatives.
   An economic division also existed among respondents, with lower
income Americans more likely to view the problem as serious and to
favor greater responses. Of those with family incomes less than
$25,000 a year, for instance, 73 percent favored more subsidized
housing, but among those earning more than $50,000 just 54 percent
agreed.
   The survey found split views on the issue of people living on the
streets by choice. Of those with an opinion, 45 percent said people
should be allowed to live on the streets if they want to, but 51
percent said they should not have that right.
   Finally, the survey asked who was mainly at fault for
homelessness _ society or the homeless themselves. Forty-five
percent said society was primarily to blame; 33 percent said the
homeless and 22 percent had no answer.

<HEAD>It's Income vs. Spending As Legislatures Convene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA BARNAS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Aid to education, prison overcrowding, insurance reform, property
tax relief and the environment are among the issues challenging
state lawmakers this year, but none looms as large as the battle of
the budget.
   It's income vs. spending, and if revenues are up, so are costs of
services. Just to stay even is more expensive, without talking about
adding money for things like schools, road repair or social services.
   ``What we face in the coming months will not be easy,''
Connecticut Gov. William A. O'Neill said last week in his
state-of-the-state address. ``We will have to say `No' when we
really want to say `Yes.'''
   Some states, including Alaska, California, Connecticut, Iowa,
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New York and West Virginia, are
running in the red or face deficits in the coming fiscal year.
Others, like Illinois, have avoided deficits by no-frills budgets
and face a backlash from the lean years.
   A lucky few are running surpluses, heating up debate on what to
do with the largesse.
   Caution abounds. New York and Massachusetts saw surpluses of a
few years ago turn to deficits _ at least $636 million in
Massachusetts' current $11.6 billion budget and more than $1 billion
in New York's budget of more than $28 billion.
   States expecting to do well this year _ Hawaii, Kansas,
Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Idaho and Maryland _ are
fearful of the same thing happening to them.
   ``It's real easy to make a tax cut right now, and we all look
good for re-election,'' says Hawaii House Finance Committee Chairman
Joseph Souki. ``But is that the wisest thing?''
   Lawmakers, having read voters' lips, are loath to talk about
hiking taxes. The idea is being mentioned mainly in the states with
the biggest money woes, and the most likely candidates are increased
taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and gasoline, rather than raising state
income taxes.
   Spending on education has perhaps the highest priority. Even in
West Virginia, with a fiscal headache totaling $680 million,

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether Congress may outlaw all sexually explicit telephone dial-up
message services, known as ``dial-a-porn.''
   The justices will rule, sometime by July, on the validity of a
   A federal judge in California ruled that the law could be applied
to ban all obscene messages, but he struck down the law's ban on
July 19 ruling on past Supreme Court decisions that excluded obscene
material _ but not all sexually explicit or indecent material _ from
material.
   Sable Communications of California Inc., a major purveyor of
dial-a-porn services in that state, filed a counter-appeal
challenging the part of Tashima's ruling that allows the ban on
materials judged to be obscene.
   Today, the justices granted review to both appeals.
   Twice in 1988 the justices had refused to review dial-a-porn
controversies, in cases from Arizona and New York.
   Obscenity is a legal term that does not apply to all sexually
explicit material.
   The Supreme Court since 1973 has defined obscenity as a work that
appeals to a morbid interest in sex with patently offensive
depictions or descriptions of sexual conduct, and one that taken as
a whole has no serious literary, artistic, political or scientific
value.
   Sexually explicit material, often called pornography, may or may
not be legally obscene.
   In 1978, the high court drew a distinction between obscene and
``indecent'' expression when it allowed federal regulators to
restrict the broadcast of indecent language.
   Upholding the government's power to punish use of ``dirty words''
over the airwaves at times when children might be listening, the
court seemed to adopt the Federal Communications Commission's
definition of indecent _ ``patently offensive references to
excretory and sexual organs or activities.''
   Congress in 1983 imposed restrictions on the dial-a-porn business
but did not seek a total ban until enacting the 1988 law.
   ``Congress concluded that there was no sufficiently effective
measure to eliminate access of children to dial-a-porn short of an
outright ban,'' Justice Department lawyers told the court.
   They said the court's 1978 decision restricting the broadcasting
of indecent language ``suggests that (the 1988 law) is consistent
with the First Amendment,'' the constitutional protection of freedom
of speech.
   The government's appeal acknowledged, however, that the FCC's
general counsel has said the commission believes the 1978 Supreme
Court ruling does not authorize a total ban on merely indecent
language.
   Lawyers for Sable Communications argued that the entire 1988 law
should be struck down.
   Dial-a-porn companies make their services available to callers
through 976-exchange numbers and AT&amp;T's area code 900 long-distance
lines.
   The telephone company typically charges callers according to
per-call rates, retaining a portion of the charges and giving the
remainder to the dial-a-porn company.
   The 976 and 900 exchanges also are used for other,
non-controversial types of messages such as sports scores, time
checks and stock market reports.
   The cases are FCC vs. Sable Communications, 88-525, and Sable
Communications vs. FCC, 88-515.

<HEAD>Court to Decide if Justice Must Supply Magazine with Tax Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether the Justice Department must supply a weekly tax magazine
with copies of all federal trial court opinions and orders in tax
cases.
   The justices said they will review a ruling that the Freedom of
Information Act imposes such an obligation on the Justice
Department's tax division.
   Government lawyers, warning of ``enormous administrative costs
and burdens'' at taxpayer expense, contend that the 1966 law imposes
no such obligation.
   Tax Analysts, a Washington-based weekly magazine reporting
legislative, judicial and regulatory developments in federal
taxation, first invoked the FOIA in 1984 in seeking timely copies of
federal court opinions and orders from the Justice Department.
   Such opinions and orders are available to the public from the
individual courts but the magazine had difficulty in obtaining them
quickly.
   The Justice Department's tax division turned down the magazine's
FOIA requests, and a federal trial judge upheld the denial.
   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last April 29
that the government must comply with the magazine's FOIA requests.
   ``Imposing an enormous and costly administrative burden on the
Justice Department to secure already publicly available material for
a commercial publication is certainly not the commonly perceived
purpose of the FOIA,'' the appeals court said. ``Nonethleless, we
cannot find in the words of the statute any exemption to cover such
a situation.''
   The appeals court added that ``the burden in this case may not be
so excessive as the department makes out.''
   Government lawyers estimate that complying with the Tax Analysts
requests on a regular basis would cost nearly $75,000 a year for
search time alone.
   They say commercial publishers and law firms would flood the
Justice Department with similar FOIA requests if the appeals court
ruling is not overturned.
   The appeals court ruled that federal trial court opinions and
orders sent to the Justice Department are ``agency records'' under
the FOIA, and that they are being ``improperly withheld'' from the
tax magazine.
   In the appeal acted on today, government lawyers said the appeals
court was wrong on both points.
   The case is Justice Department vs. Tax Analysts, 88-782.

   George Bush today studied President Reagan's
$1.15 trillion budget, and a transition official said the
president-elect ``agrees with its intent'' although still planned to
submit his own modifications.
   Bush transition spokeswoman Sheila Tate said that the vice
president himself might issue a brief statement on it later in the
day.
   But another transition official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that Bush was prepared to say that Reagan's spending
outline ``says for one thing that you can meet the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings targets without raising taxes.''
   It was a reference to the federal spending law that limits the
deficit in the fiscal 1990 year _ the one the new budget covers _ to
no more than $100 billion. The Reagan document envisions a $92.5
billion deficit.
   ``It's a good budget that does that,'' the Bush transition
official continued. ``Naturally, he agrees with its intent. And,
naturally, he'll have his own recommendations, or put forth
potential amendments, once he takes office.''
   ``But he won't be presenting any of those recommendations until
he's prepared to present all of them to the Congress, whatever time
that might be,'' the official said.
   The Reagan budget was designed, in part, to smooth the way for
the upcoming Bush budget plan, Reagan administration and Bush
transition officials said.
   Outgoing Budget Director Joseph R. Wright Jr. said Sunday the
final Reagan budget was designed with a ``dual purpose'' in mind,
summing up Reagan's philosophy while providing Bush ``with a good
base to begin negotiations with Congress.''
   Bush himself has said he won't submit a completely new plan of
his own, but will outline what he'll ``add here and take off
there,'' much of it to be spelled out in an address to a joint

   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether federal magistrates are constitutionally authorized to
preside over jury selection when delegated such duty by federal
trial judges.
   The court said it will study the case of two men convicted in
federal court in New York City of possessing cocaine with intent to
distribute it.
   Jose Gomez and Diego Chavez-Tesina say their convictions were
tainted because the judge who presided over their trial assigned the
task of jury selection to a federal magistrate.
   Their appeals argue that such a delegation of authority violates
that part of the Constitution bestowing judicial power.
   Gomez was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 10 years parole.
Chavez-Tesina was sentenced to 20 years in prison and a lifetime
parole.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the two men's
convictions last June 1.
   The appeals court said the Federal Magistrates Act authorizes
such delegation of power for the jury-selection portions of trials,
and that the federal law does not violate the Constitution.
   Gomez and Chavez-Tesina had argued that magistrates only could be
assigned pretrial duties.
   Justice Department lawyers urged the high court to use the case
to resolve conflicting rulings on magistrates' authority between the
2nd Circuit court and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based
in New Orleans.

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 13 grafs to UPDATE with judge issuing restraining
<TEXT>
   A federal judge this morning issued a
temporary restraining order blocking a 3-week-old immigration
service rule that opponents say has left hundreds of Central
Americans living in tents and shanties in the lower Rio Grande
Valley.
   ``One would be blind not to recognize that we have a problem,''
said U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela, upon issuing the order sought
by attorneys fighting the rule.
   Vela set a hearing for 9 a.m. Thursday, when he said he would
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   Attorney David Ayala, representing the INS, had asked the judge
instead to delay considering the restraining order until Thursday to
   ``Your honor, the Immigration Service is not to blame for the
plight of the people who are out there,'' Ayala said.
   The judge's restraining order restores the right of asylum
seekers to travel farther into the United States and submit their
applications in the INS districts where they intend to live.
   Hundreds of Central American asylum seekers have set up camp in
the Rio Grande Valley to await the processing of their applications.
Some 300 applicants camping in a field near Brownsville have been
ordered to leave the primitive tent city by this afternoon because
it's private property.
   Today's ruling doesn't affect the property owner's order, except
that the 300 persons in the tent city would be free now to go to
another part of the United States.
   The 300 have been sleeping under sheets of plastic supported by
tree limbs for the past week in a field across the street from the
Casa Oscar Romero shelter for Central American refugees operated by
the Roman Catholic Church, which is filled to capacity.
   The INS policy, which was effective Dec. 16, also had limited the
aliens' ability to work during the waiting period while their asylum
applications were processed, at least 30 days.
   Previously, aliens who entered the country illegally in southern
Texas were allowed to pursue their asylum applications in other
cities, often Miami or Los Angeles.
   INS officials say the change was adopted to reduce huge case
backlogs in those cities and curb frivolous refugee claims. The INS
maintains that most of the 300,000 asylum applicants who passed
through the Harlingen District last year were ineligible for
political asylum because they merely wanted to better themselves

   An airplane on a military test flight
crashed minutes after takeoff from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
this morning, killing both occupants, a base spokeswoman said.
   An Air Force pilot and a civilian were aboard the two-seat XX-300
twin-engine plane owned by Jaffe Corp. of San Antonio, Texas, said
Wright-Patterson spokeswoman Kathy Higgins.
   Ms. Higgins said the civilian in the plane was a representative
of Jaffe, the plane's manufacturer.
   Neither the Air Force nor the State Highway Patrol, which was
investigating the crash, knew which victim was flying the aircraft.
Names of the dead were not immediately released pending notification
of relatives, Ms. Higgins said.
   The turbo-prop plane was being demonstrated to officials at
Wright-Patterson as a possible replacement for the T-37, which the
Air Force plans to replace as its primary training vehicle.
   The plane departed from Wright-Patterson about 8:55 a.m. and
disappeared from base radar screens nine minutes later, Ms. Higgins
said. The wreckage was found in a rural area in northwestern Clinton
County, about 17 miles southwest of Wright-Patterson.

<TEXT>
   Both engines on a brand-new Boeing 737
apparently failed before the plane crashed along a highway, killing
46 people, officials said today. Aviation experts said the chances
of double-engine failure were about 10 million to one.
   ``So far the evidence, although by no means conclusive, is
consistent with the right engine having stopped before impact and
there are also signs of fire in the left engine,'' Transport
Minister Paul Channon said in an interview on British Broadcasting
Corp. television.
   Olivier Fagard, a spokesman for the company that makes the CFM-56
engines the jet used, told The Associated Press, ``It is extremely
improbable that both motors would break down in such a short
interval.''
   ``We have very impressive reliability statistics,'' said Fagard,
of the French company SNECMA, which builds the engines in consortium
with General Electric Co. ```We don't know. It has been established
that there was no fire in second motor. But we don't know any more
than that,'' he said.
   Officials raised the number of confirmed dead to 46 late today.
Eighty people were injured.
   Investigators recovered the flight recorders from the wreckage,
and firefighters pumped foam onto the crumpled jet to prevent
seeping aviation fuel from catching fire.
   The Belfast-bound British Midland Airways jet carrying 126 people
broke into three pieces on the edge of Britain's main north-south
highway, the M1, in central England on Sunday night.
   The twin-engine Boeing 737-400 narrowly missed the town of
Kegworth and plowed into an embankment a few hundred yards short of
the runway as the pilot struggled to make an emergency landing at
East Midland Airport, 100 miles north of London.
   Ham radio operator Mervyn Solloway said he heard ``not a shouted
message, but a bit of a frantic one to say, `We've got problems with
the other engine.' That was the last I heard from the aircraft.''
   British Midland Airways said sabotage was not suspected in the
crash, which came less than three weeks after a bomb blew apart Pan
Am Flight 103 over the Scottish village of Lockerbie, killing all
259 people on board and 11 on the ground.
   But Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who flew to the scene and
visited survivors at Derby Hospital, said: ``We rule out nothing, we
simply can't. There will be a lot of speculation, but until we have
the facts it is unsafe for me to speculate.''
   Asked about terrorism, Channon replied: ``I don't rule out
anything at this stage but there's certainly no evidence of it.''
   William Tench, retired head of Britain's Air Accident
Investigation Board, said the odds against both engines failing on a
Boeing 737 were 10 million to one.
   ``I would look for some inadvertent technical mistake such as
something incorrect being done to the engines during turnaround,
either inadvertently or deliberately,'' Tench said.
   British Midland said the jet was delivered just 12 weeks ago and
had flown less than 500 hours. It grounded its other 737-400 for
inspection.
   Pilot Kevin Hunt, a 25-year veteran, was among the badly injured
cut from the wreckage. The last survivor, a woman, was pulled from a
tangle of metal and crushed seats more than seven hours after the
crash.
   The plane's two giant wings, heavily loaded with fuel, remained
virtually intact. The severed tail section of Flight BD92 loomed
from woodland alongside the highway, surrounded by wreckage from the
severed center and nose sections.
   ``It makes you wonder how anybody walked from it,'' said
Leicestershire county Chief Fire Officer Barry Pearson.
   Survivor John McCrea said passengers were being served dinner
when the plane got into trouble soon after takeoff from London's
Heathrow Airport.
   ``The captain said `prepare for emergency landing' or something
to that effect, so we braced our heads and about five seconds ...
afterward we were down on the ground with a crash,'' McCrea said
from his bed at the Derby Royal Infirmary in nearby Nottingham.
   Belfast lawyer Mary McHugh, 26, another survivor, said: ``I
thought we were all going to get burned alive. I just thought:
`That's it, I'm dead.' I was terrified of burning to death.''
   At least four British Army soldiers serving in the troubled
Northern Ireland province were killed. The Royal Ulster
Constabulary, the Northern Ireland police force, said several of its
officers were on board.
   As East Midland Airport, the airline's home base, reopened today,
55 relatives of the dead and injured were flown in from Belfast.

   The Legislature doesn't convene until later
this month, but members have already begun tackling one of the
toughest issues _ office space.
   It's a cutthroat political game, played like this: Legislative
leaders get the best offices, veteran legislators fight over the
leaders' old offices and new members scramble for whatever's left.
   Rep. Marlin Schneider of Wisconsin Rapids, who's in charge of
office assignments, humorously threatened to call in an air strike
by the Wisconsin National Guard unless warring factions in the
Capitol's north wing resolved their own territorial dispute.
   In the same spirit, he proposed capital punishment _ and
something worse than that _ for legislators who try to make off with
their old office furniture.
   ``Failure to cooperate may result in death by firing squad, or no
pork for you in the budget,'' he warned colleagues in a memorandum
on unauthorized furniture moving.
   But even that dire threat didn't keep Rep. Joseph Wineke of
Verona from moving his desk chair from his old office to his new one.
   ``I stole that chair personally years ago, and I'm keeping it,''
Wineke said.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said Monday he will
seek passage of legislation to deny foreign chemical companies
access to U.S. markets if they are found to have assisted in the
proliferation of chemical weapons.
   Nickles said the bill will be an effort ``to put some teeth'' in
a proposed international agreement banning the use, storage and
production of chemical weapons worldwide.
   ``This is an effort to make sure that if we do catch them we
would do something about it,'' said Nickles, noting that certain
West German chemical companies are alleged to have helped Iraq and
Libya attain chemical warfare capability.
   Nickles, who attended the ongoing conference on chemical weapons
in Paris, told a news conference that while he found the meeting
helpful, he continues to believe that ``the utopian goal of banning
nuclear weapons will be close to impossible.''
   He said that events like the use of poison gas in the Iran-Iraq
war show that even some signers of the 1925 international agreement
banning the use of chemical weapons have clearly violated it.
   ``Measures are lacking that would impose some penalties if
countries don't comply,'' he said. ``We have to have some teeth
behind these treaties.''
   He said he will seek passage, in partnership with Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, of legislation imposing
sanctions on individual companies involved in chemical weapons
proliferation.

   The savage beating death of a pregnant
33-year-old physician at Bellevue Hospital has triggered a major
police investigation and a review of security at the shaken

   ``This is a major case and at least 50 detectives are assigned to

   ``It was a particularly brutal, outrageous murder,'' said Mayor

<HEAD>U.S Suspends Direct Export Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Export-Import Bank on Monday stopped
offering direct loans to foreign governments for purchasing U.S.
goods, reflecting President Reagan's desire to terminate the program
the government issued more than $207 million worth of loans to
finance purchases of U.S. exports.
   The bank said it will continue its $11 billion program for
guaranteeing such loans by private banks.
   Most of the loans have gone to Third World counties, whose total
debt has risen largely in recent years _ much of through their
failure to pay interest due on the loans.
   Spokesman Hal Sundstrom said Exim's board of directors acted at a
meeting Friday.
   ``In the real world, tough choices have to be made in order to
reduce our national budget deficit,'' Exim Bank president John A.
Bohn, Jr. said in a statement Monday.
   Reagan's budget proposal would keep a $100 million ``war chest''
for directo loans to compete with subsidized loans granted by other
industrial governments. It proposed $10.567 billion for guarantees
next year, down from $11 billion this year.
   As of Dec. 22, the bank had guaranteed $239 million worth of
private bank loans, Sundstrom said. The guarantees also encourage
U.S. exports by allowing banks to make loans to the borrowing
country on easier terms _ lower interest rates and longer repayment
periods.
   Reagan has tried to cut the direct loans before, but Congress has
voted the money anyway.
   The suspension of new loans will last ``until the 1990 Eximbank
loan budget situation clarifies,'' the bank said in a statement.

   The state Employee Grievance Board has
upheld the firing of a math teacher who lost his job following
charges of insubordination because he wouldn't wear a tie and dress
pants to class.
   Gary Pagels, a West Virginia Federation of Teachers spokesman,
said the decision was made Friday and Bill Webb, a teacher at Point
Pleasant High School, has been notified by mail.
   Pagels said Webb's grievance was denied and the board said his
firing was justified.
   Webb, of Gallipolis, Ohio, was dismissed Dec. 19 for refusing to
wear a tie and dress pants while teaching. The Federation of
Teachers contended the Mason County Board of Education violated
state law by imposing a dress code after the legal date for making
changes in Webb's employment contract.

the case will be appealed to circuit court.

<HEAD>Nurse Goes On Trial For Allegedly Giving Fatal Medicine Doses</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nurse's colleagues jokingly called
her ``Angel of Death'' because elderly patients kept dying during
her shift. Now, she is going on trial, charged with killing 17
patients in a two-year period.
   Michaela Roeder admits giving the fatal doses to six of the
patients, and says she did it to spare them pain. But prosecutor
Karl Hermann Majorowsky alleges she did it just as a ``demonstration
of her power.''
   ``The accused posed as a mistress over life and death. We are
dealing here with cold-blooded murder out of base motives,'' a Jan.
9 issue of Der Spiegel magazine quoted Majorowsky as saying.
   Ms. Roeder's murder trial begins Tuesday in district court in
Wuppertal, about 37 miles north of Bonn. She faces a possible
sentence of life in prison if convicted.
   The accusations against Ms. Roeder, 30, have absorbed the West
German press, who have called the alleged killings ``nearly the
perfect murder'' because they went almost unnoticed by police.
   On a tip from a hospital employee, authorities had the bodies of
28 deceased former patients of the intensive care unit at St. Petrus
Hospital in Wuppertal exhumed.
   According to court records, the examinations showed that 17 of
the patients had received a ``fatal dose'' of drugs that can
severely affect blood pressure or the heart.
   Ms. Roeder is accused of issuing the fatal injections between
February 1984 and February 1986 while working in the St. Petrus
intensive care section.
   After Ms. Roeder's arrest in March 1986, she admitted to law
officials that she gave fatal injections to six patients because she
wanted to spare them suffering from their ailments. Majorowsky says
in court papers there are ``no clues that these patients would have
died.''
   Most of the 17 patients were elderly and had been brought to the
intensive care section after operations for ailments ranging from
appendicitis to cancer, according to news reports. The oldest victim
was 94, according to the reports.
   The official cause of death for the 17 patients was heart or
circulatory failure, the reports said.
   Ms. Roeder began working at the hospital in 1978 and was jokingly
dubbed the ``Angel of Death'' by her colleagues when elderly
patients under her care started dying, according to Der Spiegel.
   ``They didn't call Michaela Roeder the `Angel of Death' because
they suspected foul play,'' the magazine wrote. ``The little joke in
this name was meant to help console her over her bad luck and these
unfortunate coincidences.''
   The magazine said Majorowsky is expected to have difficulty
proving murder against Ms. Roeder.
   ``The weak point of the charge is the motive brought against the
defendant. Killing in order to demonstrate power, to feel that she
was a mistress over life or death?,'' the magazine asked
rhetorically.
   Der Spiegel said the trial will likely investigate whether Ms.
Roeder may have been unable to withstand the stress and demands of
working in an intensive care unit. More than 40 witnesses and
medical experts are expected to testify.
   If there is insufficient evidence for premeditated murder, Ms.
Roeder could be found guilty of manslaughter, which carries a
minimum sentence of five years in prison.

   Libya said Monday the United States has launched a
``vile campaign'' against it with allegations over a chemical
weapons plant, and accused Washington of helping Israel stockpile
nuclear, chemical and biological arms.
   Foreign Minister Jadalah Azouz Ettalhi, speaking at an
international conference on chemical weapons, dismissed U.S. charges
that Libya has a chemical weapons plant as ``clearly false.''
   The Libyan minister mentioned the United States only once by name
_ to condemn the downing of two Libyan jet fighters last week _ and
referred to Israel as the ``racist Zionist entity.''
   He urged the international community to condemn the incident Jan.
4 over the Mediterranean as a military aggression. The United States
has said its action was in self-defense.
   Charges that Israel has nuclear weapons are at the heart of a
campaign by Arab states to link bans on nuclear and chemical arms.
The issue has stymied progress on a final communique to be issued
Wednesday at the close of the five-day conference.
   Ettalhi said the U.S. position on chemical weapons was
discriminatory.
   The United States and the Soviet Union admit to having large
stockpiles of chemical weapons _ the only two countries to make such
an admission of about 20 nations presumed to possess the weapons.
   There is a widespread fear that nations without a nuclear
capability will stock chemical arms.
   ``How can any member of the international community proclaim a
right it denies others,'' Ettalhi said, ``while at the same time
launching a vile campaign of calumny on the basis of a
discriminatory, racist position?''
   ``Agreed international rules must be applied to all parties
without discrimination,'' the Libyan minister said.
   Earlier Monday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told
reporters that evidence presented to him by Secretary of State
George Shultz on the alleged chemical weapons plant at Rabta, south
of the Libyan capital of Tripoli, did not prove anything.
   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, also attending the
conference, charged Monday that Iraq, Syria and Libya _ three bitter
foes of Israel _ have chemical arms and represent ``a direct
threat.''
   U.S. arms control official Lynn Hansen, asked about Libya's
charge that Israel has nuclear weapons and that the United States
helped it obtain them, said: ``I'm not going to get down and grovel
with the Libyans about this or that.''
   Israel has never responded directly to allegations it has nuclear
weapons, saying only it will not be the first country to introduce
such weapons into the Middle East.
   Britain joined the United States on Monday in rejecting a link
between nuclear and chemical weapons bans.
   Ettalhi's speech was widely regarded as subdued in a conference
that has seen outbursts and public disputes since it began Saturday.
   Most delegates walked out of the conference hall before a speech
earlier Monday by South African Foreign Minister R.F. Botha.
   Hansen, head of the bureau of multilateral affairs at the U.S.
arms control agency, called the conference ``positive'' but admitted
difficulty in reaching a consensus on the final statement.
   The conference is aimed at reaffirming the only existing
international document on chemical weapons _ the 1925 Geneva
Protocol banning their use _ and pressing for a global,
comprehensive ban.
   Iraq's known use of chemical weapons in its eight-year war with
Iran has served as a macabre backdrop for delegates. A top U.S.
expert, speaking on condition of anonymity, said evidence shows that
Iraq was the chief producer of chemical arms among Arab nations,
followed by Syria. He said he had no information on Israel.
   A conference source said the final statement would necessarily
have to accommodate the demands of the Arab nations.
   The statement ``will have to take into account the preoccupations
of certain Arab countries,'' said the source, speaking on condition
of anonymity. ``But it is a bit too early to say what form that will
take.''
   A working version of the final statement obtained by The
Associated Press made no direct reference to linking nuclear and
chemical arms. But it referred to the need to obtain ``general and
complete disarmament.''
   It called on each state here to ``exercise restraint and act
responsibly'' on the issue of chemical arms until a convention
banning use, production and stocking of chemical weapons is reached.
   The final document will be of a political nature with no
enforcement power. But it is meant to pressure negotiators in Geneva
to overcome obstacles in talks that have languished for nearly a
decade.
   The Geneva convention would ban use, production and stockpiling
of chemical arms by all nations, but negotiators have failed to
reach agreement on such major issues as verification.

   President-elect Bush bestowed cautious praise
on President Reagan's parting budget Monday, saying he ``agrees with
its intent'' while making clear he will develop his own proposals.
   ``I will continue to review it for possible amendments after I
assume the office of the presidency,'' Bush said in a succinct
written statement on the $1.15 trillion spending plan Reagan sent to
Congress for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   Bush also said he will have nothing further to say on his own
budget plans until after he takes office on Jan. 20.
   Craig Fuller, a senior Bush aide, read the vice president's
budget statement at a briefing but declined to elaborate upon it.
   He said the vice president ``has not made any final determination
about what shape (his) budget document, or framework, or
presentation'' will take. Fuller said Reagan's budget showed that
what Bush had talked about during his campaign, meeting
deficit-reduction targets without raising taxes or disturbing Social
Security ``is do-able.''
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady _ whom Bush has asked to stay
on _ told reporters that ``work is actively under way'' on Bush's
budget modifications.
   ``It is certainly possible that much of the current budget will
remain on the table, although it is too early at this stage to offer
more specific details,'' Brady said.
   Brady also said that Reagan's budget, by proposing the legally
required deficit reduction without seeking higher taxes, meets a
goal ``fully shared by President-elect Bush.''
   The vice president, in his statement, said that Reagan's farewell
budget ``is an excellent budget which demonstrates clearly that the
targets set under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law can be met and
indeed exceeded without raising taxes.
   ``Naturally, I support its intent,'' he added.
   The deficit law calls for a fiscal 1990 deficit of no more than
$100 billion. The new Reagan budget projects a deficit _ assuming
adoption of all its elements _ of $92.8 billion for 1990, down from
an estimated $161.5 billion deficit in the current fiscal year.
   During his campaign, Bush advocated what he called a ``flexible
freeze'' on federal spending. The concept calls for holding the
increase in overall spending at the annual rate of inflation _
currently running at about 4.4 percent.
   Any proposed additional increases would have to be offset by
corresponding decreases in other programs _ except that Social
Security benefits would not be touched.
   Bush will have to find room in the Reagan budget outline for the
increases in spending needed for the ``kinder, gentler nation''
programs he proposed in his campaign _ including expected increases
for education, child care, expansion of the government's Head Start
program and enviromental cleanup.
   And, even though Reagan's budget appears to smooth the way for
some of these modifications, in some cases the document appears at
odds with Bush's campaign statements.
   For instance, Bush has proposed an increase of Medicaid to help
cover medical expenses for poor pregnant women and their babies.
Reagan, in the new budget, has proposed over $1 billion in Medicaid
reductions.
   Reagan's budget again calls for austerity in social programs and
would eliminate 82 programs. At the same time, the plan would
work.
   Both he and incoming Defense Secretary John Tower have talked
the area of troop strength.

vice president did not want to upstage the president on Monday by

   Children swarmed onto a parade ground Monday
to say goodbye to the first of 3,000 Cuban soldiers scheduled to
leave by April 1 under a peace agreement for southern Africa.
   They thrust flowers into the hands of officers and soldiers as
Defense Minister Pedro Maria Tonha told the men assembled at the
training camp: ``Don't ever forget Angola, because you fought and
died here.''
   The first 450 Cubans are to depart Tuesday, in a symbolic
airlift, under terms of the agreement mediated by the United States
and signed Dec. 22 by Angola, Cuba and South Africa. The rest of the
3,000 troops are expected to return to Cuba by ship.
   Angola and Cuba have asked the United Nations to pay the
estimated $800 million cost of sending the estimated 50,000 Cubans
home from Angola.
   Their repatriation is part of a plan intended to bring peace to
southern Africa and independence to South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia, after U.N.-sponsored elections.
   Not included in the agreement are rebels fighting Angola's
Marxist government with U.S. and South African support, and the
South-West Africa People's Organization, a guerrilla group opposing
South African control of Namibia.
   Tonha decorated 13 ranking Cuban officers, including Gen. Raul
Menedez Tomassevic. Among those attending the ceremony were Gen.
Abelardo Colome Ibarra, vice minister of the Cuban armed forces, and
Gen. Pericles Ferreira Gomes of Brazil, head of the U.N. observers
who will monitor the withdrawal over 27 months.
   Cuban officials at the Funda camp 22 miles northeast of Luanda,
the capital, said the ceremony brought together the largest number
of Cuban officers ever assembled outside the Carribean island nation.
   Soldiers from Cuba arrived in July 1975, to support the
government that won control after independence from Portugal in its
battle with rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola.
   The United States has said it will continue military assistance
to UNITA until the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
agrees to negotiate with the rebels.
   Brig. Gen. Rafael Moracen Limonta, who first came to Angola in
1965 as an adviser to Marxist guerrillas fighting the Portuguese,
said the departure was possible because South Africa agreed to
withdraw from southern Angola, where its forces pursued SWAPO
guerrillas, and allow independence in Namibia.
   ``The problem with UNITA is among the Angolans themselves,'' he
said, standing with other officers on the parade ground. ``We came
here because of the South Africans.''
   Angola and South Africa agreed to a cease-fire in southern Angola
on Aug. 8, and South African troops withdrew into Namibia.
   South Africa captured Namibia from Germany in World War I and
controlled it under a League of Nations mandate. The U.N. General
Assembly ended the mandate in 1966, but South Africa had refused to
leave.
   All but a token South African force is to withdraw from the
territory by Nov. 1, when Namibia is to hold its first free
legislative elections.
   Some questions remain about how 70 military and 20 civilian U.N.
observers will monitor the departure of Cuban troops from a country
14 times the size of Portugal.
   Gen. Ferreira Gomes said he would rely on the ``good word'' of
the Cubans and Angolans, but another military observer said
privately his mission is ``to count heads.''
   The observers are from Algeria, Brazil, Congo, India, Jordan,
Norway, Spain and Yugoslavia.

   Officials cleared a second company
alleged to have helped Libya build a chemical weapons plant, and a
ranking lawmaker said such accusations have totally discredited West
German businesses.
   A Finance Ministry spokesman in Bonn, the capital, said a probe
of the Hamburg-based Pen Tsao medical material company turned up
``no evidence they are connected in the Libyan affair.''
   Spokesman Walter Prax said the subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based
Pen Tsao was investigated by Hamburg-state officials from Jan. 3
through Jan. 7.
   Prax said in a telephone interview that the Finance Ministry
ordered the probe after Washington alleged that West German
companies were helping Libya build a chemical weapons plant in
Rabta, 60 miles south of Tripoli. Libya says the plant produces
pharmaceuticals.
   West German officials in the southern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg
last week announced no evidence was found connecting the
Imhausen-Chemie company in the Black Forest city of Lahr of being
involved with the Libyan plant.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz expressed his trust of
West Germany's handling of the probe to West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher in Paris over the weekend.
   But Hans Stercken, a federal lawmaker and member of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Party, said in a radio interview
that he was not satisfied.
   ``I say in all openness that it (Shultz's comments) doesn't
suffice for me'' Stercken said in an interview with the
Cologne-based Deutschlandfunk radio. ``This doesn't concern the good
intentions of the Federal Republic, which no one has seriously
questioned.
   ``What it concerns is that businesses in the Federal Republic
(West Germany) have been totally discredited,'' said the lawmaker,
who heads Parliament's foreign affairs committee.
   He said the United States has not supplied details about the
American suspicions as requested. West German and U.S. officials
were expected to meet this week to review the allegations.
   Stercken also said the issue should not have come to a head
through the American media and that the United States and West
Germany should have had more communication about the U.S.
allegations.
   ``One cannot deal with each other in this manner,'' he said.
   U.S. media reported last week that in addition to West German
companies, Italian and Japanese firms were supplying Libya with
material and know-how to build the plant.

<HEAD>Iraq Rewrites History to Rehabilitate Reviled Monarchy</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Iraq is rehabilitating its brief monarchy,
the reviled ``regime of henchmen'' that was begun by the British in
1921 and ended with the murder of the third king in 1958.
accompanied by the first moves toward political liberalization after
   Books and articles have appeared reviewing and reassessing the
War I and Iraq was created from the provinces of Baghdad, Basra and
Mosul.
   Faisal I, third son of Sherif Hussein of Mecca who had lost his
succeeded him. Faisal II was killed in the coup of 1958.
   After 30 years of neglect, the Religious Endowment Ministry has
allocated the equivalent of $3 million to refurbish the royal
cemetery, where the kings and some family members are buried.
   King Hussein of Jordan, a cousin of Faisal II and an important
ally of President Saddam Hussein in the war with Iran, appears to
have been the main influence for rehabilitation.
   When the Jordanian monarch visited Baghdad recently, President
Hussein accompanied him on a visit to the cemetery.
   The ruling Baath Socialist Party attached the ``regime of
henchmen'' label long ago and no one dared defy its version of
history. Now, suddenly, the party allows the same kings to be
portrayed as great nationalists, leaders in the quest for Arab unity.
   ``I'm 100 percent sure that they did not betray their country. .
.. There were only differences of opinion,'' Abdullah Bakr, the last
chief of the royal court, wrote in a magazine article that would
have been impossible before.
   Last month, Saddam Hussein announced a program of political
reform that includes allowing opposition political parties, amnesty
for political prisoners, improvements in human rights and
encouraging private enterprise.
   Western and Arab diplomats question how far he will go toward
reform, but the flood of publications about the monarch emphasizes a
notable decline in censorship.
   The books and articles have spurred debate on whether the time
has come for a reappraisal of Iraq's entire turbulent history _ a
tale of kings, tribal warfare, coups, assassination, Kurdish
rebellion and war encompassed by less than seven decades.
   ``We weren't afraid of them when they were alive, so why should
we fear them when they're dead?'' an Iraqi official said in an
interview, speaking of the discredited kings.
   Fadhil Hussein, a University of Indiana graduate who teaches in
the Baghdad University history department, said it may be too soon
to reassess the monarchy.
   ``You can't prevent historical truth from being marked by
political and social loyalties,'' he told an interviewer. ``History
cannot be written when our recent past still has a great impact on
our present.''
   Nonetheless, books on the subject have sold thousands of copies
and new editions are being printed. Many have been serialized in
newspapers.
   Historians and other academics have differed about the role of
the monarchy in shaping modern Iraq.
   Britain had sought to create a coherent political entity and the
monarchy was a unifying element for a time, but Iraq soon was torn
by tribal rebellion, massacres and political intrigue.
   Iraqis generally have resented the monarchy as the creation of
the British, but many politicians now see the kings as realists who
believed the nation's integrity and development depended on British
protection from external threat.
   Whether they tell the whole truth or not, the publications have
succeeded in bringing history to the attention of younger Iraqis.
   ``There's a huge gap in the new generation's thinking about the
monarchy,'' said Ahmed Fawzi, who has written a dozen books about
his country's short life.
   He described his writings on the monarchy as a ``dignified
revival of history'' for people who are not familiar with the period
and have not received an ``objective account'' from official
teachings in government schools.
   ``The idea is to record the events of this period'' so other
versions ``cannot be easily fabricated,'' he said.

   Sniff. Hack. Honk.
   If it seems to you that you have the same exact cold as everybody
you know _ maybe the throat's not too bad, but the sneezing is
relentless, or the cough is terrible but the sniffles haven't shown
up _ you're probably right.
   There are ``a couple of hundred'' viruses that can cause the
common cold, according to Dr. Larry Anderson, a virus specialist
with the national Centers for Disease Control. ``There will be a
range, of maybe more than one agent, circulating at a given time _
but you also may have one predominant virus.''
   And a certain virus, he said, ``will have certain types of
symptoms.''
   Thus, it's not surprising when everyone in the office is
spreading what comes to be known as ``the same cold.''
   ``They're likely to have the same virus,'' Anderson said.
   During the winter, a particular influenza strain often comes to
dominate the flu season from coast to coast. A particular cold
virus, however, doesn't usually spread that far, Anderson noted:
``By and large, other viruses don't spread in a national pattern
like flu does.''
   The cold going around ``may vary from community to community, or
even from time to time within the community,'' he said. ``There can
be one, or several types of rhinoviruses causing the colds.''
   There are a number of government agencies doing research on the
common cold _ one of the most loathed diseases around, albeit not
the most serious.
   The CDC and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases study colds. The Food and Drug Administration evaluates
cold treatments. Even the National Center for Health Statistics
keeps some facts and figures on the disease-related impact of colds.
   But with all that, there's no cure in sight _ partly because a
cure would have to be able to wipe out some 200 specific viruses.
   ``There's so many of them, it's not like you can develop one
vaccine that will take care of the common cold,'' Anderson said.
``If you develop one, other viruses are going to evade it.''

   Working families with children and incomes
under $18,576 may qualify for a ``tax refund'' even if they owe no
tax.
   The special benefit is called the earned-income credit, and can
be worth up to $874 in savings. A qualifying worker can arrange to
have the credit paid out in advance in paychecks throughout the year.
   In general, the credit is available to any worker who received
wages, tips, fees or other earned income in 1988 and whose adjusted
gross income was less than $18,576. The worker must have had a
dependent child living with him or her for more than six months last
year.
   A married worker must file a joint return to qualify for the
credit; it also is available to a person whose filing status is
qualified widow or widower with a dependent child, or head of
household.
   Instructions accompanying tax Forms 1040 and 1040A tell how to
determine if you can claim the credit. IRS Publication 596 has a
