   First lady Nancy Reagan was saluted Monday night
for her sense of style and her contribution to the American fashion
industry.
   Mrs. Reagan was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by
the Council of Fashion Designers of America at its eighth annual
awards ceremony, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
   ``There are many pluses and minuses to being in the White House.
One of the pluses is trying to help an industry that is one of the
most important in our country and I think the American fashion
designers are the best,'' said the first lady, who was wearing a
brilliant red floor-length gown designed by Oscar de la Renta.
   ``And when I found myself in the position to make others aware of
that, or at least try to, I was delighted to do so,'' she added.
   Broadcaster Barbara Walters, in presenting the award to Mrs.
Reagan, said the first lady and the president, during his eight
years in office, ``gave us pride, gave us hope, gave us style ...
that intriguing, all-encompassing word that says so much. Style.
Presence. A sense of beauty. ... Nancy Reagan has style.''
   Prior to the awards ceremony, de la Renta, president of the
council, said of Mrs. Reagan: ``I think she put American fashion on
the pedestal where it belongs and brought elegance back to American
fashion.''
   Designer Donna Karan said of Mrs. Reagan: ``The contribution to
fashion she has made goes beyond her clothing to her sense of
sophistication, caring and elegance as first lady of the United
States.''
   Calvin Klein, accompanied by his wife Kelly, said: ``She has
shown how women can look so well-groomed, so attractive and so
American.''
   Mrs. Reagan has been criticized for borrowing much of her
high-priced wardrobe while living at the White House _ a practice
critics said amounted to free advertising for the designers whose
clothes she wore.
   But Ms. Walters said she thought a first lady should be
``encouraged to borrow'' because it ``stimulates American industry.''
   Her comment caused the 500 ceremony guests to applaud vigorously.
   Mrs. Reagan had worn the de la Renta gown she wore to the
ceremony on at least three other occasions, said Wendy Toler, a
spokeswoman for the first lady.
   Also among those recognized at the ceremony was designer Geoffrey
Beene, who was saluted for making ``fashion as art.''
   Performer Liza Minelli, one of many women attending the ceremony
who dressed in Mrs. Reagan's favorite color, red, presented the
Perry Ellis award for new fashion talent to Isaac Mizrahi, whom she
called ``a brilliant and startling talent.''
   Ms. Minelli wore a floor-length gown with a leg-revealing slit
designed by Mizrahi.
   Actress Audrey Hepburn, wearing a red gown designed by Givenchy,
presented a Lifetime Achievement Award to photographer Richard
Avedon, for his ``pictorial contribution to American fashion and his
photographic reportage of historical events.''
   Bill Robinson received the award for menswear design. Nina Hyde,
fashion editor of The Washington Post, was recognized for her
reporting on American fashion.
   Karl Lagerfeld, designer for the house of Chanel, received a
special award for his international fashion influence.
   Grace Mirabella, former editor-in-chief of Vogue magazine, was
recognized for her promotion of American fashion in the media.
   Judith Peabody, a member of the board of directors of the Gay
Men's Health Crisis Inc., received the council's special
humanitarian award.

<HEAD>Former Nazi Propagandist Seeks Refuge In Canada</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Yale University lecturer who was
stripped of his American citizenship in 1986 for his role as a Nazi
propagandist in the Soviet Union during World War II has asked for
refugee status in Canada, a report said Monday.
   Vladimir Sokolov disappeared in July when he was scheduled to
appear at a deportation hearing in Hartford, Conn.
   His whereabouts were unknown until he applied for refugee status
in Montreal sometime before Jan. 1, claiming that his life would be
in danger if he was forced to return to the Soviet Union, the
Canadian Broadcast Corp. reported.
   No date has been set for an immigration hearing, the report said.
   From 1942 to 1944, Sokolov was a writer and editor of a Russian
language newspaper published by the German army in his hometown of
Orel, 220 miles south of Moscow. Anti-Semitic articles appeared
under his name, although he has maintained that the most offensive
tracts were written by Nazi censors.
   His Canadian lawyer, Julius Grey, said Sokolov faces almost
certain death if deported to the Soviet Union.
   ``The Soviet press has been gloating over his return and have
called him a traitor,'' Grey said. ``He would likely be put to death
or given a lengthy sentence. For all practical purposes it would be
the end of his life.''
   Grey, a noted constitutional lawyer who is also defending
convicted murderer John Joseph Kindler from extradition to the
United States where he faces the death penalty, said the 75-year-old
Sokolov is in very poor health.
   Sokolov failed to reveal his wartime activities in 1951 when he
entered the United States as a displaced person. He became a citizen
in 1957 and two years later began lecturing on Russian language and
Soviet dissident literature at Yale.
   His past was uncovered by the Yale student paper in 1976 and he
later resigned. But the U.S. government waited until 1982 before
filing a complaint to strip him of his American citizenship.

<TEXT>
   Four former Ku Klux Klan members entered
guilty pleas in federal court Monday for their part in a violent
clash in 1979 with black marchers.
   The four were the last of nine former Klan members who were
indicted and eventually pleaded guilty to federal charges stemming
from the gunfire in a Decatur parade that wounded several people.
   There were no fatal injuries in the 1979 confrontation. The
wounded included police officers.
   Two of the former Klansmen _ Ray Winford Steele and William
Riccio _ pleaded guilty Monday to a felony count of obstruction of
justice and a misdemeanor count of conspiring to violate civil
rights.
   The other two _ William Johnny Mason and Lynwood White _ pleaded
guilty to the misdemeanor conspiracy count.
   The former Klansmen were accused of blocking a Southern Christian
Leadership Conference march on May 26, 1979. The marchers were
protesting the prosecution of a mentally retarded black man charged
with the rape of a white woman in Decatur.
   The misdemeanor conspiracy count carries a maximum sentence of
one year in prison and a $1,000 fine. The felony count carries a
maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   U.S. District Judge John Hancock delayed sentencing for up to a
month.

<HEAD>1986 Tax Reform Benefits Farmers When Income Grows, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department analyst says the 1986
tax reforms can mean substantial savings to farmers when incomes
rise but that the old federal rules allowed bigger breaks as
earnings decline.
   Clifford V. Rossi of the department's Economic Research Service
said the Tax Reform Act of 1986 can reduce overall tax liability for
farmers by an average of 4.5 percent from previous levels.
   Rossi used a computer model and information from more than 15,000
federal tax returns of ``farm sole proprietorships'' for 1982 to
come up with the estimates. His findings were in a new staff report
circulated by the agency.
   Farm sole proprietorships were defined as ``self-employed
individuals filing a Schedule F federal tax form,'' which is the
basic paperwork required of farmers by the Internal Revenue Service.
   ``In general, lower marginal tax rates and generous expensing
provisions will offset repeal of the investment tax credit and
capital gains preference,'' the report said. ``Taxpayers with high
off-farm incomes receive little benefit from the new law.''
   Rossi noted that farm incomes can vary greatly because of
weather, economic conditions and other factors. So he performed a
``sensitivity analysis'' that includes a 25 percent increase and
another that includes a 25 percent decrease on farm income.
   The increase in net farm income resulted in a 10.9 percent
increase in federal tax liability under the old rules and only an
8.3 percent increase under the 1985 law, he said.
   By contrast, Rossi showed that a 25 percent drop in income would
result in a decline of 8.7 percent in taxes under the old federal
system and only 7.7 percent less under the new reforms.
   ``In terms of net winners and losers from tax reform, taxpayers
engaged in field crop and general livestock operations benefit more
from the new tax laws than other farm groups,'' he said. ``All
sectors, with the exception of the dairy sector, experience net
reductions in tax liabilities under tax reform.''
   Rossi said dairy farmers suffer under the new tax law ``because
of low taxable incomes that consequently cannot offset the loss of
capital gains preference'' and investment tax credit, two of the
major writeoffs under the old law.
   ``Farm enterprises with relatively high capital intensities are
burdened more by the loss of certain preferences for capital
intensities than other farm operations,'' he said. ``There is also
some evidence that more generous expensing and depreciation
provisions are of greater consequence to capital-intensive
operations than other farm types.''
   Rossi said the 1986 law ``tends to reduce tax burdens for
taxpayers with low and moderate levels of income'' and that those
whose taxable incomes were more than $500,000 showed the smallest
decline in taxes.
   According to Rossi, the new study is ``the only comprehensive
assessment of tax liability in the agricultural sector'' and will
aid in future policy considerations.
   ``If history is any indicator of future activity in tax policy,
the Tax Reform Act of 1986 will undergo refinement or overhaul in
the years ahead with accompanying effects on agriculture,'' he said.

   Tokyo continues to be the most expensive world
capital for groceries, according to the Agriculture Department.
   A 16-city survey by the department's Foreign Agricultural Service
in November showed that a retail market basket of selected food
items cost more than $144 in Tokyo, while the lowest cost was in
Brasilia at $27. In Washington, D.C., the same items were about $53.
   In order, the 16 capitals and market basket costs included:
Tokyo, $144.10; Stockholm, $99.92; Bern, $96.62; Seoul, $63.25;
Madrid, $59.64; Paris, $56.89; Rome, $58.64; London, $55.63;
Washington, D.C., $53.26; Bonn, $51.59; Canberra, $49.77; Ottawa,
$49.41; Buenos Aires, $40.99; Mexico City, $31.94; Pretoria, $31.17;
and Brasilia, $27.08.
   The agency said the food items ``reflect purchases more typical
of U.S. consumers rather than those of other nations'' and that
caution should be used in making comparisons. Differences in
quality, packaging and seasonal variations in supply were cited.
   Among the items, sirloin steak was shown at $10.71 per kilogram,
or about $4.87 per pound, in Washington, D.C., and $57.06 per
kilogram, or $26 per pound in Tokyo. In Brasilia, sirloin was $2.75
per kilo, or $1.25 per pound.
   The comparisons were begun by USDA many years ago to bolster
claims that Americans pay lower prices for food than many other
people in the world.

   Rising food prices in China may help spur
greater interest in imported U.S. farm commodities, according to an
Agriculture Department trade report.
   ``The combination of rising incomes, inflation fears and the
expression of pent-up consumer demand for almost everything has
created a sellers' market for most agricultural goods as well,''
according to the report in the January issue of Ag Exporter magazine.
   Higher prices for grain, livestock and dairy products are
expected to encourage imports of breeding animals, feed grains,
soybeans and meal, and wheat and wheat flour, the report said.

<TEXT>
   One of every three men and women walking down
the aisle in the United States has been married before, but the
remarriage rate for divorced Americans has been declining, according
to a National Center for Health Statistics report.
   The government report also shows that most divorced men marry
divorced women and that of those divorced Americans remarrying in
1983, the women were on the average 34 years old and the men, an
average 37 years old.
   The report is based on samples of records from states that
compile marriage and divorce statistics. It studies data collected
from 1970 to 1983, the latest year for which most of the figures
were available.
   The number of remarriages increased during the period studied,
rising from 404,000 in 1970 to 736,000 in 1983 for divorced women
and from 423,000 to 773,000 over the 14-year period for divorced men.
   But although the number of remarriages was growing over those
years, the pool of divorced men and women was growing faster, the
report said.
   In 1983, the remarriage rate for divorced women was 91.6 per
1,000 compared with 123.3 per 1,000 in 1970. The rate for divorced
men was 142.1 per 1,000 compared with 204.5 per 1,000 in 1970, the
report said.
   ``Thus, only 9 percent of divorced women and 14 percent of
divorced men remarried in 1983, compared with 12 percent of divorced
women and 20 percent of divorced men in 1970,'' the report said.
   The figures also show that most women marry men of the same
marital status. In 1983, the report said, 55 percent of all women
and men who married were both single, 19 percent were both divorced
and 2 percent were both widowed.
   Men traditionally are older than the women they marry, and this
generally holds true for remarriages as well as first marriages,
according to the study. The only combinations in which that trend is
broken is for divorced and widowed women who marry single men. In
1983, widowed women were an average 2 years older and divorced women
were an average 1 year older than the single men they married.
   Many of the patterns for first marriages don't hold up for second
and subsequent marriages, the report noted.
   While more than three-quarters of first marriages are performed
in religious settings, the proportion drops to about 60 percent for
marriages involving divorced men and women.
   Also, first marriages have a typical seasonal pattern _ many more
are performed in the summer than in the winter, the report said. But
second and subsequent marriages tend to be spread more evenly
throughout the year.

   Two employees of a McDonald's Restaurant
were fatally shot during a robbery Sunday and a suspect was arrested
hours later at a Wilmington, Del., bus station, officials said.
   Robert P. Hughes IV, 21, of Glen Mills, was arrested at about
8:40 a.m., said Wilmington police Sgt. Richard Andress. Hughes was
charged with resisting arrest, carrying a concealed deadly weapon
and was held as a fugitive, Andress said.
   In Pennsylvania, Hughes was charged with two counts of murder,
two counts of criminal homicide, robbery and weapons violations,
said James P. MacElree II, Chester County district attorney.
   Extradition proceedings probably will begin this week, Andress
said.
   Restaurant manager Jean Reider, 41, of Newark, Del., and Charles
Hegarty, 46, of West Chester, were killed in the holdup, which
occurred before the restaurant had opened, police said.

<TEXT>
   Fear that the U.S. government will go it alone
in world trade is discouraging other countries from joining in an
accord that could cut spending on farmers by tens of billions of
dollars every year, according to a report published by the
International Monetary Fund.
   Fund experts see a possibility that James M. Baker III,
designated as secretary of state by President-elect Bush, will
single out favored countries as trading partners instead of
promoting U.S. trade with the whole world.
   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, whose
members include the governments of the major industrial countries,
says farm subsidies cost consumers and taxpayers $185 billion a year
between 1984 and 1986. The biggest costs are in the United States,
western Europe and Japan.
   The IMF report cites a speech last year by Baker, then secretary
of the treasury. Baker spoke of what the U.S. government would do if
there were a failure of the trade talks now being held by
representatives of 96 countries.
   ``We might be willing to explore a `market liberalization club'
approach, through mini-lateral arrangements or a series of bilateral
agreements,'' Bush was quoted as saying.
   Bilateral agreements are like the new one between the United
States and Canada, freeing up trade between two countries but
tending to freeze out others. A similar deal with Israel was made
earlier last year. A ``mini-lateral'' arrangement includes not just
two but a group of countries, like the 12 in the European Economic
Community.
   Groups of this kind encourage trade among members at the expense
of those outside the club.
   The report was written before last month's meeting in Montreal of
representatives from the 96 governments. They agreed on how to
negotiate 11 different kinds of trade issues in the remaining two
years of talks. But they failed to agree on four others, including
agriculture.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter insisted that other
governments, especially the Europeans, promise to join in a
long-term phase-out of subsidies before he would talk about cutting
them in the immediate future. Bush has picked Yeutter as his
secretary of agriculture.
   On Thursday Alan Holmer, Yeutter's deputy as trade
representative, said he was optimistic about agreement being reached
on farm issues by April, a new deadline set at Montreal. But
negotiations are being soured by a fight between the European
community and the Reagan administration over the hormones that U.S.
farmers use to make their cattle grow faster.
   Last Sunday the community, which tries to keep its own farmers
from using hormones, banned imports of U.S. beef and veal worth over
$100 million a year. The Reagan administration retaliated with
increases of 100 percent in import duties on such items as Danish
hams and sun-dried tomatoes from Italy, a measure designed to make
them too expensive for Americans to want to buy. The Europeans are
threatening a counter-reprisal and U.S. officials say they have a
list ready should that happen.
   A truce is in effect at least until Jan. 23, when ministers of
foreign affairs from the 12 countries are due to meet in Brussels.
Bush will have been inaugurated three days earlier and the new
administration may have some ideas for getting the talks back on the
rails. Yeutter is to be replaced as trade representative by Carla
Hills.
   The report published by the International Monetary Fund is called
``Issues and Developments in International Trade Policy.'' It was
written by a team under Margaret Kelly, an Australian who heads the
fund's Trade and Payments Division.
   The fund is owned by 151 countries, with the United States
holding the biggest block of votes.

   General Douglas MacArthur and others directing
the occupation of Japan after World War II resisted powerful U.S.
and allied opposition in keeping the late Emperor Hirohito on the
chrysanthemum throne, where he reigned for another 43 years.
   The emperor's prosecution for war crimes, execution, imprisonment
or exile was favored by 70 percent of Americans in a public opinion
poll seven weeks before the end of the war. Some allied governments
had similar views.
   MacArthur, supreme commander of the U.S. occupation of Japan, was
the best known of those resisting demands for punishing the monarch
who died in Tokyo Saturday at the age of 87 after a 62-year reign
marked by military expansion, crushing defeat, reconciliation,
dramatic economic growth and new heights of prosperity and prestige
for his country.
   Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and six other Japanese officials were
convicted and hanged as a result of the Tokyo war crimes trials.
Tojo's testimony at one point threatened to implicate the emperor in
whose name the militarists had overrun East Asia.
   Documents released in Washington 25 years ago by the State
Department show that MacArthur and other U.S. officials decided
retention of Hirohito was vital to maintaining order in the former
enemy country and carrying out their mission of democratic reform.
   But those planning Japan's future were also aware that the
emotions of war had generated powerful sentiment in America and
other allied countries for prosecuting and ousting the mikado as
responsible for aggression and atrocities of the imperial military
command, the documents showed.
   George Gallup, director of the American Institute of Public
Opinion, declared June 23, 1945, that ``the average American''
thinks Hirohito ``should be treated like any other war criminal.''
   In his latest Gallup poll, he said, 33 percent of those
questioned said Hirohito should be executed, 17 percent said ``let
the court decide his fate,'' 11 percent said ``keep him in prison
the rest of his life'' and 9 percent wanted to exile him. Only 4
percent favored ignoring him as a mere figurehead, 3 percent said
``use him as a puppet to run Japan.'' Other replies or no opinion
accounted for 23 percent.
   MacArthur wrote in his memoirs that Hirohito had already been
stricken from the list of potential war crimes defendants when the
monarch first visited him Sept. 30, 1945. Hands trembling, the
emperor offered to bear sole responsibility for the war, MacArthur
wrote, adding that, ``I knew I faced the First Gentleman of Japan in
his Own Right.''
   Four months later, the five-star general messaged Washington that
Hirohito's indictment and execution could trigger a convulsion,
potential chaos and guerrilla warfare in Japan. One million
occupation troops might be needed and ``all hope of introducing
democratic methods would disappear,'' MacArthur said.
   George Atcheson Jr., MacArthur's State Department adviser, told
Truman in 1946: ``There is no question that the emperor is most
useful. He is obeyed ... he manifests sincerity in wishing to aid in
the accomplishment of our general objectives and is seemingly more
anxious to be democratic than some of the people around him.''
   A specialist strongly advocating retention of the emperor was
Hugh Borton, member of the U.S. State-War-Navy coordinating
committee in Washington that began studies before the end of the war
on occupation policy and sent its findings to MacArthur.
   Reached at his home in Conway, Mass., Borton, now 83, said the
committee favored keeping Hirohito on the basis of expert opinion
that ``he was one who could more influence the Japanese populace
than anyone else, and the important thing for the United States was
to make the occupation as effective as possible rather than a
continuation of the war.''
   First indications, in August 1945, that the emperor might be
retained produced a strong but mixed reaction in Congress. Sen. Tom
Stewart D-Tenn., said the emperor is ``a war criminal and I'd like
to see him hung up by his toes.''
   Sen. William Langer, R-N.D., said the emperor ``ought to be
treated like Hitler.''
   Sen. Richard Russell, D-Ga., who later introduced an unsuccessful
resolution urging trial of the emperor, called anything less than
unconditional surrender ``a terrible mistake.''
   But Sens. Styles Bridges, R-N.H., Elbert Thomas, D-Utah, and
Robert Taft, R-Ohio, said it should be possible to deal sternly and
effectively with Japan and simplify military operations by working
through the emperor.

   President Reagan's submission today of his
$1.15 trillion federal budget for fiscal 1990 triggers a work
schedule that is specified by law, cited with reverence by lawmakers
and then routinely ignored.
   This year should be no different.
   The law calls for Congress to have completed work on the spending
plan by April 15. In addition, all 13 appropriations bills that
finance the federal government are supposed to be in place by the
Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year.
   But that rarely happens, and ingredients for delay abound this
year.
   Congress will be treating Reagan's proposal as largely
inconsequential and waiting for a new plan from President-elect Bush
after his inauguration. The House Budget Committee isn't even
planning any hearings on Reagan's blueprint and will wait instead
until it receives something from Bush.
   In addition, Bush's repeated pledges to avoid new taxes puts him
in direct conflict with many congressional leaders who say the
additional revenues will be unavoidable.
   ``There probably hasn't been a year in the last five where the
likelihood of keeping to the budget schedule is less likely,'' says
Stanley E. Collender, the Washington-based director of federal
budget policy for the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse.
   This hasn't stopped top members of Congress from their usual
pledges to move quickly on the budget.
   Last Monday, Congress' first day in session, House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, set a goal of meeting budget deadlines and said,
``So far as the speaker can influence the schedule, we shall perform
our work on time.''
   And new Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn.,
expressed the same desire in a telephone interview last week, adding
that the delay caused by the presidential transition ``doesn't waive
the provisions of the law'' setting the budget work schedule.
   But history shows that fiscal and political crises, not
timetables, govern the budget process.
   Budget deadlines set by law come and go with no real consequences
if they are missed.
   But three key fiscal events are scheduled to occur roughly
simultaneously this fall and are likely to spur action in what
Collender, borrowing from the language of New Age adherents, calls
``the political equivalent of the harmonic convergence.''
   Sometime this August or September, the government is expected to
reach its debt ceiling of $2.8 trillion, meaning that legislation
will be needed for it to be able to borrow more money.
   At the same time, if there is no budget agreement between
Congress and the White House, the mechanism will begin that
ultimately triggers the dreaded automatic spending slashes required
under the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. Those cuts _ which are
seen by most people as draconian _ would take effect Oct. 1.
   In addition, September is the last month of the fiscal year. Some
sort of legislation that provides money must be in place by Oct. 1
or the government cannot function.
   Stalemates are common when it comes to the budget because the
blueprint is the most basic statement of the government's
priorities. It not only perpetually creates institutional struggles
between the executive and legislative branches, but it is a
battleground for Democrats and Republicans positioning themselves
for future elections.
   Last year was unusual for its budget harmony because most of the
crucial decisions were made at a summit among Reagan administration
officials and congressional leaders shortly after the October 1987
stock market crash. It was the first year in 12 in which all 13
spending bills were finished by Oct. 1.
   In 1987, spending legislation was not completed until nearly
Christmas, three months into the fiscal year.

   Prince Charles has angered British farmers by
linking intensive farming methods with erosion and the destruction
of wildlife.
   ``People are becoming increasingly concerned about the damage to
the environment arising from the application by farmers of the
principle of the maximization of production,'' he said in an address
to an organic food production conference this weekend.
   ``It is increasingly felt by members of the public that
large-scale soil erosion, the destruction of wildlife habitat and
the excessive use of chemicals and unnatural substances are
unacceptable and cannot continue without ruining the countryside for
future generations and probably causing long-term health hazards.''
   National Farmers' Union President Simon Gourlay said the prince
had ``gone over the top in sounding the alarm bells and I do not
think he's justified in saying there's a buildup of long-term
environmental problems.''
   Charles has shown a penchant for voicing public concerns, most
notably in the field of urban development and architecture.

   Shoes have put former U.S. Rep. John
Jenrette back in the news.
   The South Carolina Democrat, who was convicted in 1980 in the
FBI's Abscam investigation, faces charges of petty larceny for the
theft of a pair of shoes and for altering price tags at a suburban
Washington, D.C., department store, authorities said.
   He is scheduled to go to trial in Fairfax County, Va., on Feb. 1,
said his lawyer, Warren McLain.
   ``It was a silly, silly mistake,'' Jenrette said Saturday, adding
that if he hadn't lost his temper over the Dec. 7 incident, the
arrest ``probably wouldn't have happened.''
   Jenrette said he was trying on a pair of rubber work shoes at the
store when he heard that cars parked outside were being towed. He
said he walked outside with the shoes on because he thought he had
parked his car in a ``questionable area.''
   Two security guards immediately ``jumped on me,'' Jenrette said.
An argument ensued and ``the next thing I knew they signed a
warrant.''
   Jenrette also denied charges that he altered prices on a pair of
pants and a shirt from a clearance table.
   Following Abscam, his former wife, Rita, appeared seminude in
Playboy. She wrote a book about how she and Jenrette made love at
the U.S. Capitol and how she found $25,000 stuffed in his brown
suede shoe.

   Thirteen-year-old Drew Barrymore, the lovable
little girl in the movie ``E.T.,'' said agents hired by her mother
put her in handcuffs to take her back to the hospital after her
binge of substance abuse.
   In September, she said, she took a break from her initial
hospital stay for drug and alcohol use to audition for a play in New
York, and broke her 88-day string of sobriety when she snorted
cocaine in a nightclub restroom.
   She said she then stole her mother's credit card, flew to Los
Angeles, snorting more cocaine, and went on a shopping spree.
   Her mother hired private agents who handcuffed her and sent her
back to the hospital, according to her first-person account in this
week's People magazine.
   She said her descent into drug and alcohol abuse began with her
rise in fame. ``From the time I became famous in `E.T.,' my life got
really weird,'' Miss Barrymore said.
   Miss Barrymore was released from her second stay at a
drug-and-alcohol rehabilitation hospital shortly before Christmas.
She said she drank at age 9, smoked marijuana at 10 and snorted
cocaine at 12.
   ``It was frightening. I was this 7-year-old who was expected to
be going on a mature 29,'' she said. ``By the time I was 8{, I felt
like I was some abnormal, crazy girl. I could walk up to the door of
any nightclub and they'd say, `Hi, you're that little girl. Come
in.'''
   Last June, after a beer binge, Miss Barrymore had a showdown with
her mother and ``started throwing things _ glasses, vases. They were
breaking all over the floor. I went from party girl to jerk of the
planet.''

   Singer Chuck Berry thinks the nondescript terra
cotta building at 2120 S. Michigan Ave. should take its rightful
place as a historic location in the development of urban blues.
   ``I recorded some of my biggest hits at that address,'' Berry
recalled recently. ``I have a lot of memories of it. They were great
days of great music.''
   The building once was the mecca for the nation's blues musicians
_ the home of Chess Records. This week, the Commission on Chicago
Landmarks will consider the nomination of the two-story building for
city landmark status.
   During the 1950s and 1960s, passersby might have seen Howlin'
Wolf, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, the Dells, or the Rev. C.L. Franklin
and his daughter, Aretha.
   Bluesman Willie Dixon said he would like to make the building the
national headquarters for his Blues Heaven Foundation, which raises
money for music scholarships, and perhaps a blues museum.
   ``It is part of the history of America,'' Dixon said. ``Remember,
all rock is the blues by rearrangement. And the blues should have a
place, a home, so the world knows where they came from.''

<HEAD>Town Looks To City-Owned Utility For Lower Electric Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCH WEISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLYDE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city manager is on the verge of flipping a
switch that will send electricity flowing through city-owned power
lines, a change he says will save money for residents of this
northern Ohio town.
   But officials for the Toledo Edison Co., which now supplies
electricity to the town's 5,600 residents, say a municipal power
system will be unreliable and electric rates will eventually
increase and surpass their rates.
   City Manager Nelson Summit admits that the Clyde Light and Power
Co. is a gamble.
   ``What it boiled down to was I felt there was a better way to
provide electricity. It turned out that it is going to be cheaper
and rates will get a lot better in the future,'' Summit said in a
recent interview.
   But Toledo Edison is putting up a fight.
   It filed a lawsuit last month after the city refused to start
negotiating the renewal of the private company's franchise to serve
the city. The contract expires in June 1990.
   Toledo Edison wants to force Clyde to explain to the state Public
Utilities Commission why the company should not be allowed to
compete with the new municipal system in Clyde, about 30 miles
southeast of Toledo.
   Toledo Edison will lose about $7 million to $8 million annually
in revenues if the franchise is not renewed, said Mark Everhart,
general manager of the utility's eastern district.
   The utility has 275,000 customers in northwestern Ohio. ``Losing
Clyde is kind of like cutting the heart out of a distribution
system,'' he said.
   The conversion to a city-owned system had its beginnings five
years ago when Summit moved to Clyde and saw his electric bills
double.
   Voters in November 1987 approved a $10 million bond issue to set
up the utility company. Early last year, the city agreed to buy
power wholesale from the Canton-based Ohio Power Co. at 3.1 cents
per kilowatt hour.
   The city wanted to buy Toledo Edison's distribution system, but
the company's selling price of $30 million was too high, Summit said.
   Now, Clyde is building a new substation, distribution and
transmission lines. Its first customer, a Whirlpool Corp. plant, is
expected to be on line in early March, Summit said.
   The City Council recently set rates for the new system at 7 cents
per kilowatt hour. The current rate is 9.5 cents and the average
household pays $52 a month. That's expected to drop to $39.
   More than 80 Ohio communities have municipal electric systems,
most buying power wholesale from utilities, but no municipal system
has been set up since the early 1900s.
   Clyde's operation is being closely watched by other Ohio
municipalities interested in cutting electric rates.
   ``There is no doubt about it, a precedent has already been set
and Toledo Edison is worried,'' Summit said.
   But there are several inherent problems with municipal power
systems, Everhart said. In coming years, some cities may have
trouble buying power wholesale because supplies will diminish, the
utility company official said.
   ``A no-frill utility company will work fine until the wind blows
hard, until there is a major accident and until something goes
wrong. And then all of a sudden, you are left holding the bag,''
said Everhart.

   A Belfast-bound jetliner carrying 126
people crashed beside a highway in central England on Sunday and
broke into pieces, killing at least 37 people and injuring 76,
officials said.
   The airline said the crash was caused by engine failure and ruled
out sabotage.
   The British Midland Airways Boeing 737-400 was en route from
London's Heathrow Airport to Northern Ireland when it developed
engine trouble, the Civil Aviation Authority said.
   The jet attempted to land at East Midlands Airport near
Nottingham, about 100 miles north of London, but undershot the
runway by a half-mile and crashed alongside a highway, smashed into
an embankment and broke apart, police said.
   Witnesses reported seeing an engine in flames as the aircraft
came in low, dropping bits of debris and shearing off treetops as it
careened toward the highway. Cars swerved to avoid the hulk and
there were a few minor injuries from auto collisions, police said.
   ``We believe that 37 people have died as a result of this
accident, but there are still some people in the wreckage,''
Leicestershire Assistant Chief Constable Tony Butler told a news
conference.
   He said he did not know whether the trapped people were dead or
alive. It was also not certain that all 37 were aboard the plane,
since police reported there may have been casualties in cars on the
highway.
   After nearly eight hours of rescue efforts at the edge of
England's busiest north-south highway, one of the people aboard was
still trapped alive in the wreckage and two bodies awaited recovery,
the Leicestershire Ambulance Service said.
   Police in the county of Derbyshire reported several bodies
scattered on each side of the highway. Two nearby hospitals reported
a total of 76 people injured.
   ``All of them seemed to have smashed ankles and legs, and with a
lot, their faces were badly damaged too,'' said Joe Weston-Webb, 50,
who lives in the nearby village of Sutton Bonningale and was among
the first on the scene. He helped rescue several people and saw many
bodies in the wreckage.
   ``It seems a miracle that any one got out alive though, and I
can't believe that it all didn't go up in flames. It was
horrendous.''
   The plane, a new aircraft that only had been in service for three
months, was carrying 118 passengers and eight crew, the airline said.
   The crash was the second major air tragedy in Britain in three
weeks. On Dec. 21, a Pan Am Boeing 747 bound for New York blew up
over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on
the ground. That jet had also left Heathrow. A bomb was blamed for
the crash.
   The flight Sunday took off from Heathrow Airport at 7:52 p.m. and
its engine caught fire 10 minutes later, the Department of Transport
said.
   The pilot told the control tower he had the engine fire under
control, but when the plane was still one to two miles out, ``it was
clear that there would be an accident,'' airport official Michael
Cowan told a news conference.
   `As the plane approached the control tower it was apparent it was
too low,'' he said.
   Airline executive Colin Roberts told relatives at Belfast
Airport, ``There was absolutely no question of sabotage and there
was nothing to indicate that whatsoever.''
   The accident was caused by a technical fault in one of the
engines of the new plane, which had made seven flights on the
London-Belfast route, he said. The weather was reported good.
   The 737 crashed at about 8:30 p.m. (3:30 p.m. EST) about a mile
outside the village of Kegworth, Inspector Neville Cotterill of the
Leicestershire police said.
   The tail section as embedded in the ground and the fuselage broke
into several parts spread over fields, Cotterill told The Associated
Press.
   But he added that no cars were known to have been hit as the
plane thundered alongside the M1, England's main north-south highway.
   The highway was closed as dozens of ambulances and fire engines
converged on the scene. Cries for help could be heard from inside
the fuselage. Personal belongings littered the highway.
   Rescuers dug steps into the embankment and formed a human chain
from the wreckage to the ambulances. They flattened trees and hacked
open the fuselage.
   The cockpit with a large chunk of fuselage came to rest in thick
brambles and trees near the top of the embankment.
   The pilot, Capt. Kevin Hunt, was hospitalized with multiple
injuries, British Midland said.
   A local vicar, the Rev. Michael Brandon, said he held a
passenger's hand and whispered the Lord's Prayer to him as he died.
   ``It was very dignified and peaceful. There is not a lot more you
can do in a situation like this,'' he said.
   The crippled jet roared over 16-year-old Samantha Phelby's house
just before it hit the ground.
   ``We looked outside as it got louder and as it was going overhead
we saw the left engine still on fire. Then we heard this pop, which
could have been the crash. Then we heard the fire engines,'' she
told Independent Radio News.
   Desmond Anderson, who lives 400 yards from the airport's main
runway, said, `The far side engine was on fire, backfiring and
roaring away ...
   An Automobile Association manager, John McKnight, said: ``There
are still people trapped and work is going on to free them. From the
reports I have had there is a terrific amount of wreckage. It's a
hell of a mess.''
   British Midland chairman Michael Bishop said said the pilot
reported ``severe vibrations in one of the engines'' and asked
clearance for an emergency landing at the airport.
   Bishop said the company had taken delivery of the plane only 12
weeks ago.
   Civil Aviation Authority spokeswoman Ann Noonan said the pilot
reported problems in his No. 2 engine and was having trouble
climbing. The two-engined aircraft disappeared off ground control
radar screens at 8:15 p.m.
   The Boeing 737-400 is a version of the Boeing 737 with a longer
fuselage and can carry 146 passengers. It was introduced last year.

   Political parties are struggling to emerge in
this British colony but face the formidable hurdles of apathy,
public distrust and a wary Communist China, which gains sovereignty
over the territory in 1997.
   Attempts to form the groups comes as Britain prepares to hold
Hong Kong's first general legislative elections and China appears to
have reluctantly dropped its opposition to such activity.
   The organizations will be different from Western-style political
parties because they will not be able to form a sovereign
government. Instead, they will be limited to trying to influence the
outgoing British rulers and pursuing whatever local power Beijing
permits under the ``high degree of autonomy'' it promises for this
capitalist enclave after 1997.
   ``The administration of Hong Kong will be in the hands of Hong
Kong people, so in that sense we still have a lot of power,'' said
Yeung Sum, chairman of Meeting Point, a pressure group of about 300
members that views itself as a future party.
   In recent weeks, businessman Stephen Cheong and lawyer Martin
Lee, both members of the colony's Legislative Council, have
announced plans to form political parties. Councilor Maria Tam's
Progressive Hong Kong Society also is mentioned as an emerging party.
   Those groups are expected to participate in general elections to
be held in 1991 for 10 of 56 seats on the council, which is
primarily a forum to debate policy made by the British governor and
his advisers. The council now consists of government officials,
government appointees and representatives of interest groups and
local advisory boards.
   The 1991 elections ``will be run on party lines, I'm quite
sure,'' said Joseph Y.S. Cheng, a political scientist at the Chinese
University of Hong Kong. But the groups will face huge problems in
gathering support from Hong Kong's 5.7 million people, who
traditionally distrust political parties.
   Families who fled to the coastal enclave blame China's myriad
20th century woes on both the Communists and Nationalists, who moved
to Taiwan after the 1949 revolution. Both parties operate
unofficially in Hong Kong.
   ``People in Hong Kong feel very comfortable with the status quo,
and they are afraid of political activities, political
confrontation,'' Cheng said.
   Yeung acknowledged that Meeting Point had not clearly declared
itself a political party for so long because ``all through the
years, people (have been) skeptical of the label.'' Cheong rejects
the ``party'' label for his new group.
   Political scientist Peter Harris of the University of Hong Kong
believes the groups will have trouble winning broad backing. He said
``the mass of the Hong Kong people are more interested ... in
getting the kids to school. Their understanding of issues is still
in a very inchoate stage.''
   Attempts by civic leaders three years ago to form political
parties stalled not from apathy but because of China's opposition,
according to Lee.
   That stance appears to have softened, however, with the onset of
legislative elections that China has promised will continue after
1997.
   Xu Jiatun, China's main representative in Hong Kong, said early
this month that the new constitution being drafted for the territory
effectively allows political parties.
   Many of the emerging political groups have not clearly stated an
ideology and may be identified primarily by the personality of their
leaders. Some of those leaders may seek to become Hong Kong's first
chief executive, which will be the top local post after the British
leave.
   Cheong said his group will call for stability and only gradual
political change, while Lee is the territory's most vocal advocate
of sweeping democratic reform. Three-year-old Meeting Point's goals
include a high degree of self administration for the territory after
1997, a central social security fund and more education subsidies,
Yeung said.
   Lee believes the major issue dividing the parties will be whether
they speak primarily for Beijing or Hong Kong interests.
   One big question is whether the Chinese Communist Party in Hong
Kong, which now works behind the scenes, will go above ground to
openly participate in elections.
   ``That would frighten the industrialists away, immediately,''
said Lee.
   Despite the growing activity of local political groups, Harris
sees little hope for them to wield real power, noting that
authoritarian Communist countries such as China do not accept
challenges to their rule.

   An earthquake with a preliminary reading of 5.1 on
the Richter scale shook a small island south of Tokyo today, the
Central Meteorological Agency said. There were no immediate reports
of damage or injuries.
   The tremor, which occurred at 12:15 p.m. (10:15 p.m. EST Sunday),
was centered at about 12 miles under the seabed south of Miyake
Island, about 100 miles south of Tokyo, the agency said.
   It said another undersea earthquake of lesser magnitude hit the
same area 36 minutes earlier. No magnitude was available for the
first quake.
   The island is home to 4,300 people.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its
epicenter, according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale is considered ``very
strong,'' a reading of 6 means ``severe,'' and capable of widespread
damage near the epicenter.

   They were lukewarm about the Declaration
of Independence and the Constitution. They opposed the War of 1812.
And in presidential elections they voted against their neighbor,
John Kennedy, and their governor, Michael Dukakis.
   The people of this Cape Cod community have never gone with the
flow and they show no signs of changing as they celebrate
Barnstable's 350th anniversary this year.
   ``I hate to use the cliche Yankee independence, but I suspect
there is an aspect of that,'' said Patricia Duffy, who has been
helping compile a lengthy history of the town for use in the school
curriculum. ``We are cautious. We don't jump on any bandwagons.''
   Barnstable lives in the shadow of its neighbors Hyannis and
Hyannisport, made famous by the Kennedy clan.
   But Hyannis and Hyannisport are not officially incorporated as
towns; they are merely two of seven villages in the town of
Barnstable, which occupies the midsection of the cape.
   Barnstable is the principal municipality of Barnstable County,
which encompasses all of Cape Cod. It's the state's third largest
community geographically and has a year-round population of about
35,000 that doubles during summer.
   But few outside New England know its name, although residents
hope to change that with a 12-month celebration that promises much
variety, if little peace and quiet.
   Festivities include a summer rowing regatta, a colonial costume
day, a publishing party for the Cape Cod Almanac, and a Boston Pops
concert on the Hyannis town green.
   The big celebration comes in early September, the actual
anniversary month, and includes a visit by a delegation from
Barnstable's namesake, Barnstable, England.
   The events the town will commemorate began in September 1639,
when Barnstable was incorporated under a land grant from the Plimoth
Colony.
   The town history describes reaction to the American Revolution as
mixed, with wealthy Tories quarreling with patriots over British
domination. John Crocker, whose ancestors were among the town's
first 45 inhabitants, puts it in physical terms: ``In the Crocker
Tavern (still standing) there is a gouge out of one of the beams
where a couple of fellows had a sword fight over the issue.''
   The town neither endorsed nor opposed the Declaration of
Independence. A town meeting initially voted against the U.S.
Constitution because it lacked a bill of rights.
   ``The people were more wealthy down here and they were tending
toward the status quo,'' said Robert O'Leary, a social studies
teacher.
   Early thriving industries included cranberry harvesting, which
survives to this day, shipbuilding, lumbering, oystering and
extraction of salt from the ocean. Today tourism dominates.
   Because of the importance of sea trade to Barnstable, the
townspeople opposed the War of 1812 against Britain. This time there
was no give to their position: Isaiah L. Green, the area's U.S.
representative, voted for the declaration of war and lost his seat,
according to the school department history.
   Residents remember the Kennedy era fondly. They speak of John F.
Kennedy parading through town after his Democratic presidential
nomination, and of his victory speech in Hyannis after the 1960
election.
   But at the polls, residents favored Richard Nixon by 4,515 to
2,783. They had no greater favorite-son feelings last year, when
George Bush beat Dukakis 10,026 to 9,971.
   Joseph Kennedy brought his family to Hyannisport in 1926 but it
wasn't until his son became a national figure that the sandy beaches
and sunshine of Cape Cod gained national attention and later
unrestrained development, say local historians.
   ``The beauty, uniqueness and excitement of the cape portrayed by
the press put Barnstable on the map and in the world spotlight,''
according to the school department narrative.
   Cape Codders regret some of the growth, as they showed last fall
when they supported a non-binding resolution in favor of a building
moratorium. Former U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas, a Cape Cod summer
resident, said the problems on Cape Cod are as much aesthetic as
environmental.
   ``Much of what has been built on Route 28 in Hyannis is
schlock,'' Tsongas said. ``If the development that took place was
architecturally consistent with the cape, it would not have been
half as offensive as it is.''

   The number of students entering nursing school
jumped 11 percent last year because of higher salaries and a healthy
job market, according to the magazine that surveyed more than 220
schools.
   The increase follows a nearly a one-third drop from 1983 to 1987.
   Schools responding to the annual survey, to be published today by
the trade magazine Nursingworld Journal, had a total of 15,494
freshmen in 1988, up from 13,970 in 1987.
   ``Probably the most important thing is that there has been so
much publicity about the national shortage of nurses,'' Publisher
Richard A. DeVito, said Friday.
   But a more troubling factor, DeVito said, is that many schools
have reduced entry level grade point averages to attract more
applicants. Perhaps as a result, he said, graduate nurses failed
their licensing exams at a record rate of 16 percent in 1988, four
times the 1987 level.
   The journal said it sent its survey to 1,491 U.S. nursing schools
and received responses from 227 institutions in 44 states.
   Hospital officials hailed the finding as good news for the
nation's health care system, which has been strained by a
``significant and persistent shortage'' of nurses, according to a
December report by the Commission on Nursing of the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services.
   About 300,000 nursing jobs were unfilled nationwide, the American
Nurses Association estimated last year.
   DeVito said the shortage has had a direct impact on wages,
pushing up starting salaries for registered nurses by an average of
$5,000 to $6,000 during the last five years. Registered nurses now
typically start at $22,000 to $28,000 a year, depending on region,
and experienced nurses earn up to $55,000 in some cities, he said.
   According to the survey, licensed practical nursing programs
experienced the greatest increase in beginning students in 1988,
with a 25.4 percent jump. Hospital-based diploma programs were next,
with a 14.6 percent rise.
   Baccalaureate programs at four-year colleges and universities saw
a 10.7 percent increase. The smallest change was in associate degree
programs offered by two-year junior colleges, which reported 8.7
percent more freshmen.
   DeVito cautioned that because of the decline in entrance
requirements, the overall increase of 11 percent may not necessarily
translate into an 11 percent rise in the number of graduates.
   ``The problem it's going to create is that while we have roughly
a big increase in freshman enrollees, they've lowered the admission
standards, so we may have fewer people who are going to be able to
make the grade,'' he said.

<HEAD>Method Used In Media General-Associated Press Poll On Homelessness</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Poll-Homeless, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews Nov. 10-20 with 1,084 adults in the
continental United States. The phone numbers were selected randomly
by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the
most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult
American were asked the same questions the results theoretically
would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19 of 20 times. The
error margin is larger for subgroups _ 4 points for women, for
example, and 5 for Democrats.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. In your opinion, how serious a problem is homelessness in the
United States? Is it very serious, fairly serious, not too serious,
or not serious at all? Very: 68 percent. Fairly: 24. Not too: 5. Not
at all: 1. Don't Know or No Answer: 2.
   2. Do you think the problem of homelessness is getting worse,
improving, or staying about the same? Worse: 68. Improving: 3. Same:
24. DK-NA: 5.
   3. Who do you think should be primarily responsible for helping
homeless people _ the federal government, state government, local
government or private charities? Federal: 32. State: 24. Local: 18.
Charity: 9. DK-NA: 17.
   4. Do you think federal spending on helping the homeless should
be increased, decreased or remain the same? Increased: 60.
Decreased: 6. Same: 27. DK-NA: 7.
   a. (If increased) Would you be willing to pay more taxes for
that? Yes: 86. No: 11. DK-NA: 3.
   5. Thinking about why most people are homeless, would you say
society is mainly at fault, or the homeless personally are mainly at
fault? Society: 45. Homeless: 33. DK-NA: 22.
   6. Do you think homelessness is a problem only in big cities, or
in communities of all sizes? Cities: 24. All sizes: 74. DK-NA: 2.
   7. Does the federal government do enough to prevent people from
becoming homeless, or not? Yes: 27. No: 58. DK-NA: 15.
   8. Should the federal government build more subsidized housing
for poor people? Yes: 65. No: 27. DK-NA: 8.
   9. How about people who are homeless _ should the federal
government spend more to provide them with housing? Yes: 62. No: 27.
DK-NA: 10.
   10. Should people be allowed to live on the streets if they want
to? Yes: 45. No: 51. DK-NA: 4.
   11. Are there homeless people in your community? Yes: 59. No: 37.
DK-NA: 4.

<HEAD>Attorney General Says Administration Did Not Try To Thwart Walsh
Inquiry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the
Reagan administration did not try to thwart independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh from pursuing his investigation of the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Thornburgh said Sunday that Walsh had assured him before dropping
two key charges against Oliver North that he had been dealt with
``in good faith'' and had gotten ``full cooperation from the
intelligence community.''
   Thornburgh's comments on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley'' came after questions of whether he realized his
administration's decision to withhold some classified evidence on
national security grounds would force the prosecutor to drop some
charges against the fired National Security Council aide.
   The attorney general said he himself was concerned about any
impression ``there was some kind of cover-up or stonewalling of the
independent counsel's office.''
   In a meeting Wednesday, the day before Walsh moved to drop the
charges, Thornburgh said he asked for Walsh's personal assurance
``that he had been able to follow every line of inquiry that was
available, that he had had full cooperation from the intelligence
community, and that ... everyone he dealt with had acted in good
faith.''
   Walsh ``had no hesitation in satisfying my concerns on that
score,'' said Thornburgh. Walsh has not commented publicly on the
matter.
   Thornburgh said it was ``inherent'' that if the documents were
withheld, it ``would have an eroding effect on the quality of the
government's case'' against North. But ``the decision was Judge
Walsh's.''
   Thornburgh said that apart from revealing national security
secrets, a criminal trial on the original charges probably would not
have revealed anything ``that would surprise anybody'' in light of
the Tower Commission report and congressional investigation of the
Iran-Contra affair.
   North is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 31 on a dozen remaining
felony counts, including obstruction of congressional and
presidential inquiries, false statements to Congress and improperly
converting travelers checks belonging to the Nicaraguan Contras to
his own use.

   Americans generally agree that homelessness is
widespread and worsening, and most are dissatisfied with the
government's response and would be willing to pay more taxes to
combat the problem, a poll has found.
   A plurality of the 1,084 adults surveyed in the Media
General-Associated Press poll primarily faulted society rather than
the homeless for homelessness.
   A plurality also said the federal government is chiefly
responsible for solutions.
   The poll exhibited the broad reach of homelessness: Six in 10
said homeless people were in their communities, and three-quarters
said the problem plagues communities of all sizes, not just big
cities.
   Accordingly, respondents rated the problem as extraordinarily
severe. Sixty-eight percent called it ``very serious'' and 24
percent said ``fairly serious.'' The remainder gave it less
importance.
   The national poll, conducted by telephone among a random sample
of adults Nov. 10-20, had a 3-point margin of error. It was
completed before winter's cold increased attention on the homeless.
   Still, nearly seven in 10 respondents said homelessness was
getting worse, a quarter said it was unchanged, and 3 percent saw
improvement. The remainder had no opinion.
   Views were divided on the responsibility for solutions.
Thirty-two percent said the federal government was primarily
responsible; 24 percent said state governments, 18 percent said
local governments and 9 percent said private charities. The rest had
no answer.
   Wherever prime responsibility lies, only 27 percent said the
federal government was doing enough to prevent people from becoming
homeless, and 58 percent said it was not. The remaining 15 percent
had no opinion.
   A solid 60 percent said federal spending on programs for the
homeless should be increased, and 86 percent of that group said they
would be willing to pay higher taxes for that purpose. That totaled
52 percent overall, an unusually high level of acquiescence to
higher taxes.
   On specific programs, 62 percent said the federal government
should spend more on housing for the homeless, and as many favored
the preventive measure of building more federally subsidized housing
for the poor.
   In virtually all these measures, homelessness was seen as severe
and worsening by a greater share of women, Democrats, liberals,
minorities and younger people. They also were more apt to blame
society and to favor a greater federal response.
   Seventy-eight percent of women rated the problem as ``very
serious,'' compared with 56 percent of men, for example.
Eighty-three percent of Democrats said it was getting worse,
compared with 54 percent of Republicans. And sixty-four percent of
liberals said society was at fault, compared with 37 percent of
conservatives.
   An economic division also existed among respondents, with lower
income Americans more likely to view the problem as serious and to
favor greater responses. Of those with family incomes less than
$25,000 a year, for instance, 73 percent favored more subsidized
housing, but among those earning more than $50,000 just 54 percent
agreed.
   The survey found split views on the issue of people living on the
streets by choice. Of those with an opinion, 45 percent said people
should be allowed to live on the streets if they want to, but 51
percent said they should not have that right.
   Finally, the survey asked who was mainly at fault for
homelessness _ society or the homeless themselves. Forty-five
percent said society was primarily to blame; 33 percent said the
homeless and 22 percent had no answer.

<HEAD>It's Income vs. Spending As Legislatures Convene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA BARNAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Aid to education, prison overcrowding, insurance reform, property
tax relief and the environment are among the issues challenging
state lawmakers this year, but none looms as large as the battle of
the budget.
   It's income vs. spending, and if revenues are up, so are costs of
services. Just to stay even is more expensive, without talking about
adding money for things like schools, road repair or social services.
   ``What we face in the coming months will not be easy,''
Connecticut Gov. William A. O'Neill said last week in his
state-of-the-state address. ``We will have to say `No' when we
really want to say `Yes.'''
   Some states, including Alaska, California, Connecticut, Iowa,
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New York and West Virginia, are
running in the red or face deficits in the coming fiscal year.
Others, like Illinois, have avoided deficits by no-frills budgets
and face a backlash from the lean years.
   A lucky few are running surpluses, heating up debate on what to
do with the largesse.
   Caution abounds. New York and Massachusetts saw surpluses of a
few years ago turn to deficits _ at least $636 million in
Massachusetts' current $11.6 billion budget and more than $1 billion
in New York's budget of more than $28 billion.
   States expecting to do well this year _ Hawaii, Kansas,
Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Idaho and Maryland _ are
fearful of the same thing happening to them.
   ``It's real easy to make a tax cut right now, and we all look
good for re-election,'' says Hawaii House Finance Committee Chairman
Joseph Souki. ``But is that the wisest thing?''
   Lawmakers, having read voters' lips, are loath to talk about
hiking taxes. The idea is being mentioned mainly in the states with
the biggest money woes, and the most likely candidates are increased
taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and gasoline, rather than raising state
income taxes.
   Spending on education has perhaps the highest priority. Even in
West Virginia, with a fiscal headache totaling $680 million,
Gov.-elect Gaston Caperton has promised unspecified raises to the
state's teachers, who rank 46th nationally in salaries. Illinois
education officials, who have gone two years without a significant
budget increase, are expected to seek increases totaling more than
$600 million this year.
   Coupled with increasing aid to education is the need in some
states to restructure the system for public school financing to
reduce the disparities between rich and poor districts. Montana's
Legislature must fashion a new system to replace one that a state
court last year declared unconstitutional.
   Prisons are another big-ticket item. Michigan is in the middle of
a massive prison building program; by 1991, the state will have
spent $900 million to build 28 prisons, and if projections hold
true, the system still will be overcrowded.
   ``The cost of operating prisons is eating us alive,'' said
Michigan Senate Appropriations Chairman Harry Gast.
   Virginia is building two new prisons to increase its inmate
capacity by 2,600, but corrections officials say the state still
will be at least 1,000 beds short in a few years and more money will
be sought.
   ``The cost of crime is expensive, so we must accept the fact that
the money drawn to support the criminal justice system is money that
we will not have for the wide range of other important needs
throughout the commonwealth,'' said Gov. Gerald L. Baliles.
   Once lawmakers have their budget priorities settled, they still
won't lack for issues.
   Rising auto insurance costs are expected to be debated in New
Jersey, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. And California is awaiting
the results of a court challenge to Proposition 103, a voter
initiative passed last November that requires a 20 percent rate
rollback for most kinds of insurance and tougher state regulation of
insurers.
   The environment and waste disposal is another sore spot for some
states. New Jersey suffered a second consecutive summer of beach
closings because of high bacteria levels and medical waste washing
ashore, and the Legislature passed a series of measures designed to
help clean up the state's ocean waters.
   However, other proposals to track the disposal of medical waste,
impose tougher penalties on polluters and create a powerful
commission to protect the coast remain mired in disputes.
   South Carolina residents are clamoring for reductions in the
amount of hazardous waste buried in a landfill used by more than 30
other states, and the Legislature is studying ways to deal with
rapidly filling solid-waste landfills, also a consideration in New
Hampshire.

   A second Japanese old soldier has hanged himself
after leaving a note that he wished to follow Emperor Hirohito in
death, police said today.
   A passer-by found the body of Yohichi Terunuma, 76, hanging from
a tree on a local shrine's grounds Sunday afternoon, said Akira Iida
of the police department in Katsuta, about 60 miles northeast of
Tokyo.
   Iida said a note found in Terunuma's jacket pocket read in part:
``Allow me to follow the generalissimo ... as a solider.''
   Emperor Hirohito, once considered a living god and the supreme
figure in Japan's armed forces, died Saturday of intestinal cancer
at age 87. After World War II, the emperor renounced his divine
status and a new constitution defined his role as symbol of the
nation.
   Terunuma had served as an ensign in the former Japanese Imperial
Navy during World War II.
   On Saturday, an 87-year-old man who once served with the Japanese
Imperial Army hanged himself in a shed near his home in Wakayama,
280 miles southwest of Tokyo. He also left a note saying he wanted
to follow the emperor in death, police said.
   In Japan's feudal days, there were cases in which samurai
warriors killed themselves, following their lords in death. In the
best known case in modern history, Gen. Maresuke Nogi and his wife
committed suicide on the day of Emperor Meiji's funeral in 1912.

   A flock of ducks that waddle
through yards and dirty the streets has prompted a neighborhood
civil war of sorts in which both sides are crying foul about the
other's tactics.
   The domesticated Muscovy duck population has swelled to 200,
prompting some to begin efforts to reduce their numbers. The methods
have included egg stealing, trapping, maiming, and ducks being run
down by motorists.
   ``The ducks got caught in a people problem,'' says Jim
Vanairsdale, a pro-duck member of a committee named by the City
Commission to try to resolve the yearlong dispute. ``It's sad what
has happened.''
   Those in favor of the ducks claim the animals were in the
Woodland neighborhood when the middle- to upper-class area was
established more than 20 years ago. Opponents say the birds are too
aggressive, leave droppings underfoot and mate in public.
   Many in this oceanside city of 3,200 people agreed the duck
population should be reduced, and the dispute has been focused on
how many ducks would be allowed. For some people, one Muscovy is one
duck too many.
   A duck trapper was hired to relocate the ducks to Georgia, but
there were questions about the humaneness of his trapping methods.
   The St. Augustine Humane Society helped catch others, but they
relocated them too close, enabling some to return.
   The ducks are such an emotional issue here that they dominated
three monthly meetings of the St. Augustine Beach City Commission.
One meeting erupted into name-calling before Commissioner Pete
Dodson suggested last summer that a committee find a solution.
   ``I agreed to act as a moderator. Two people from each side were
appointed to act as a committee,'' he said.
   ``We've got to live together and stop this monkey business.''
   At the committee's first meeting, Dodson asked each member to
tell him how many ducks should be allowed.
   The numbers began at zero, with the average being 17, which
became the standard.
   Then Bill Van Marter, a former city commissioner who had
supported ridding the neighborhood of Muscovy ducks, complained in
August that his wife and granddaughter were attacked by a rogue
drake in their back yard.
   Mrs. Van Marter, who declined to be interviewed, told officials
at the time that she was forced to fling the bird, ``as big as a
turkey,'' into a nearby palm tree to stop the attack.
   After the attack, the committee voted to reduce the Muscovy
population to nine adult birds, where it stands.
   Efforts also were started to filch eggs from nests.
   But when reports surfaced that motorists were purposely running
down the ducks and that ducks were being maimed by having their legs
hacked off, the dispute intensified.
   Kathryne Grove, who witnessed one of the ducks being run down,
said: ``I was sick at my stomach. Why would anyone have to murder
them or run them down?''
   During a recent 30-minute tour of the 80-home area, only six
ducks were spotted, including one getting a douse from a hose
wielded by a woman trying to get it off her property.
   The Florida Aubudon Society has little good to say about the
Muscovy ducks, a domesticated version of the wild ones in Mexico and
South America.
   ``These things are a cancer. They are not supposed to be here,''
said Wes Biggs, state coordinator of the society's Florida Breeding
Bird Atlas Project.
   ``They are a real nuisance and we would be better off without
them,'' he said, adding that ``little old lady bunny huggers''
compound the problem by feeding them and treating them as pets.
   But now that the duck population has been lowered, Dodson
believes the situation will improve.
   ``I'm very optimistic the problem will be solved,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pro-Democracy Leader Released From Shanghai Jail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China today released a 33-year-old dissident who
was active in the pro-democracy movement in Shanghai and whose case
was taken up by the U.S. Congress.
   Yang Wei, a former student at the University of Arizona, walked
from Ti Lan Qiao Prison in Shanghai today after serving one year of
a two-year sentence.
   Fu Fenghao, an official at the Shanghai Foreign Affairs office,
said because Yang spent about a year in custody before being
sentenced, he was let out on time.
   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Yang said his
first concern upon release was the health of his father, who has
cancer.
   ``I'm going to see him today,'' said Yang. ``He is in the
hospital and he is in serious condition.''
   Yang was sentenced in December 1987 for ``demagogical propoganda
for counterrevolutionary ends.''
   He had been held without charges since January 1987 in connection
with pro-democracy student demonstrations in Shanghai in 1986.
   Yang said he did not regret marching for democracy and writing
for ``China Spring,'' the banned periodical of the Chinese Alliance
for Democracy, a New York-based dissident group. But he said he was
unclear whether he would continue working for political change in
China.
   ``I just got out,'' he said, ``so I don't really understand
what's happening in society. When I determine that then I will make
a decision.''
   Yang described his treatment in prison as ``pretty good.''
   ``It seemed that I was given special treatment,'' he said.
   Yang, who received a master's degree in molecular biology from
Arizona, said he wanted to return to the United States to continue
his studies.
   Sources close to the family said Yang's release was delayed by
several hours today because three members of the Chinese Alliance
for Democracy were apprehended in Shanghai over the weekend with
copies of ``China Spring'' and a letter for Yang.
   The alliance was set up in 1983 by a former Chinese citizen to
promote democracy in China. Chinese officials have declared it an
illegal, reactionary organization.
   Two of the men _ Huang Han of Canada and Bell M.S. Wong, an
American who also goes by the name Huang Wencheng _ were ordered out
of China and flew to Hong Kong, the official China Daily said today.
   The third man, Tang Guangzhong, flew back to the United States to
continue studies at Utah State University.
   The report said the three acknowledged they were members of the
alliance. It also said they had admitted breaking the law.
   It was not clear why Tang, a Chinese citizen, was allowed to
return to the United States.
   During Yang's trial in 1987, the court said he put up
``reactionary slogans'' at Shanghai's Fudan University on Dec. 22,
1986 and sent letters to students in Canton and Beijing inciting
them to protest.
   Hundreds of thousands of students marched in dozens of cities
during the winter of 1986-87, calling for democracy.
   On Dec. 3, 1987, the U.S. Congress passed an amendment to a State
Department appropriations bill calling for Yang's release, saying he
had broken no Chinese or U.S. laws.
   China called the amendment ``an undisguised interference in
China's internal affairs.''
   Yang's wife, Che Shaoli, lives in Houston and studies
microbiology at the Baylor College of Medicine.
   She said she was thrilled at the news of his release.
   ``But I am sad, too,'' she said. ``I don't know when I will see
him.''

<HEAD>Briton Freed From Iranian Jail Speaks of Experiences</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 23-year-old Briton freed after more than two
years in a Tehran jail claims he was trying to join Afghan
guerrillas when Iranian border guards seized him on the
Iran-Pakistan frontier.
   The Mail on Sunday quoted Nicholas Nicola, who arrived back in
Britain on Dec. 27 after his release, as saying he had been kept
mostly in solitary confinement except for a weekly shower and
interrogation.
   He also confirmed reports that he had been tried, although
because the trial was held in the Farsi language, said he had been
unaware he was serving a 3{-year sentence for possessing weapons,
the newspaper reported.
   Nicola bought a ticket to Pakistan in 1986 in order to join the
Afghan rebels fighting the Soviet-backed Communist government, the
Mail said.
   ``My thoughts were to go and find the mujahedeen (Moslem
guerrillas) ... so I could fight against the Russians,'' the weekly
paper quoted him as saying. Soviets troops have backed Afghanistan's
communist government against the guerrillas in a decade-old conflict.
   Dressed in Afghan clothes and carrying a rifle and pistol he had
bought at a market, Nicola told the paper he was in Pakistan on the
border with Iran when an Iranian patrol began running toward him.
   ``I think they saw my guns,'' he was quoted as saying.
   ``One fired two shots and, without thinking, I fired two shots
into the air with the rifle,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The Iranians beat Nicola, screamed at him and then took him to
prison, he said. After his trial, he remained at Tehran's maximum
security Evin Prison, the report said.
   Nicola said he wasn't sure what to do with his life now, the
paper reported.
   ``I have been too naive,'' he was quoted as saying. ``I had
romantic ideas from the movies. I know it isn't like that now.''
   His release was the latest sign of a thaw in relations between
the countries since they virtually cut diplomatic ties in 1987 after
a dispute which began when British police arrested an Iranian envoy
on shoplifting charges.
   Roger Cooper, a British businessman who has lived in Iran for
more than 20 years, has been jailed there without trial for more
than three years on charges of spying.

   He describes himself as an extremist, a
perfectionist, a man who likes to shock people, and a man who never
wears the same dress twice.
   When he slips into a black organza evening gown, he doesn't
consider it simply cross-dressing but a craft and a challenge:
``Take it the whole distance or not at all.''
   But Gene, who asked that his last name be withheld, does not

   For Gene, 32, this time of high fashion and late-night,

as plain old Gene: He wore a fez and his performance suffered.
   Only once did his job as a clothing store manager require him to
miss Mardi Gras.
   ``It almost killed me,'' he said.
   Last year, drawing inspiration from Cher, he donned a black body
stocking that left only small, beaded bits of the anatomy to the
viewer's imagination.
   This year, even less will be more _ a trend that could drive him
into retirement.
   ``I feel a tremendous amount of pressure. I can keep coming up
with costumes, but I can't take off any more clothes than I've
already taken off,'' he said.
   ``How many more ways can I show skin and still be creative?''

   This normally quiet central Pennsylvania
community of about 7,700 has issued a rather loud eviction notice to
unwanted crows.
   After five days last week of trying to shoo the birds with loud
noise, officials said the number of crow sightings in town markedly
decreased.
   About 35,000 crows were estimated to be in the area at sundown
Friday as a propane gas-fired cannon was being set up to scare them.
The birds soon flew away.
   Police concluded the effort against the birds Saturday morning by
firing off several noisemakers to chase the few crows that had
returned.
   Various kinds of fireworks had been set off since Tuesday to
convince the birds that trees in Milton are unacceptable places for
them to roost at night.
   It remains to be seen whether the crows will return, so residents
have continued their noisemaking to ensure that their unwanted
visitors stay away.
   Resident Vida Switzer, for instance, bangs a wooden spoon against
a cast-iron frying pan, and Thomas Deans claps his hands when he
walks to and from work.

   Byron Pursifull says he's never seen a tree
he didn't like.
   And the 61-year-old building and maintenance supervisor for the
Johnson County Parks and Recreation Department intends to leave his
mark on the county in the form of greenery.
   The founder of the Johnson County Garden Club, Pursifull has
taught schoolchildren to plant crab apple trees and has designed
landscaping and planted trees in the Johnson County Park.
   Pursifull's devotion to tree planting has earned him the
attention of the National Arbor Day Foundation, which plans to honor
him April 29.
   He is one of two people who will receive the Lawrence Enerson
Award, named after a former trustee of the Arbor Day Foundation. The
award honors those whose life work exemplifies commitment to tree
planting and conservation as part of community improvement.
   ``When he's talking, they (children) listen to him and you can
tell in their eyes how interested they are in what he has to say,''
said Don G. Wertz, science coordinator at Custer Baker Middle School
in Franklin, who nominated Pursifull for the award. ``When he talks
about trees, he refers to them as `little fellows.' He's such a nice
gentleman to have around kids.''
   Pursifull's current project: planting trees at the Johnson County
Park to honor anyone who is a county resident.
   ``I sincerely hope future generations will be able to stroll
around this site while they think of loved ones honored with a
living tree,'' he said.

<HEAD>Stocks Dollar, Rise In Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices surged on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
today in the first day of trading after Emperor Hirohito's death,
and the dollar edged higher against the Japanese yen for the third
consecutive session.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected shares, a 25.75-point
gainer Friday, shot up 468.85 points, or 1.5 percent, closing at
30,678.39 points, a record high. The previous record was 30,243.66
last Wednesday.
   It was the largest one-day advance since Jan. 6, 1988.
   Saturday's half-day session of stock trading was canceled after
Emperor Hirohito died of cancer early in the day.
   A dealer at Nomura Securities said small investors were drawn
back into the market after the emperor's death.
   ``During his three-month-long illness, many individual investors
were extremely cautious and anxious about what might happen when the
emperor died,'' said Michio Katsumata. ``But that's over now.''
   Katsumata added that January is traditionally a bullish month for
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and that investors also were responding to
positive economic conditions in Japan.
   Buying interest gradually spread to institutional investors as
prices kept drifting higher through the day, other traders said.
   Dealers said shares were bought on expectations of higher prices
ahead. Many economists have predicted Japan's economy will continue
to boom until the middle of this year, due partly to continuing
domestic demand.
   ``As much as it is discouraged by the death of Hirohito, the
market has high hopes for the beginning of a new era,'' said Koji
Kamemura, head of Yasuda Mutual Insurance Co.'s fund management
division.
   Kamemura said the yen's stability in Tokyo also is providing the
market with more reason for bullish sentiment.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 126.08 yen,
0.11 yen higher than Friday's close of 125.97 yen. It opened at
126.05 yen and traded between 125.85 yen and 126.23 yen.
   The dollar now has gained 2.03 yen in three trading sessions.
   Trading was described as restrained. Some foreign exchange
dealers had anticipated the yen would dip to as low as 129 yen to
the dollar after Hirohito's death.
   An estimated $5.5 billion were exchanged in spot trading today.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Break Off Talks with Soviet Union</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrilla leaders refused today
to resume direct talks with the Soviets, accusing Moscow of playing
political games aimed at securing its communist proteges in Kabul a
place in a post-war government.
   The guerrillas promised not to attack departing Red Army troops
but said their decision to break off negotiations means fighting is
likely to continue after Feb. 15, when the 50,000 Soviet troops
remaining in Afghanistan are to withdraw under a U.N.-brokered
accord.
   The Pakistan-based guerrilla leaders ended talks with Soviet
Deputy Foreign Minsiter Yuli Vorontsov on Saturday, deadlocked over
the composition of a post-war government but saying they were ready
to meet again.
   But Vorontsov later told reporters that Moscow would find a way
to support its Marxist allies in Kabul if a broad-based government
that includes communists is not in place Feb. 15.
   Moslem insurgents, who have been fighting the Soviet-backed
communist regime in Kabul for a decade, have unanimously rejected
the participation of any of its members in a post-war government.
   Today, the spokesman for the U.S.-backed insurgents, Sibghatullah
Mojaddidi told a news conference:
   ``Because the Soviets use threats, look for war rather than
peace, and disrespect Afghans' right of self-determination, we
believe that negotiations are unproductive and unnecessary.
   ``The Soviets have threatened that if their terms are not
accepted they will supply new weapons, not deployed before, to
(Afghan President) Najib's regime after the withdrawal,'' said
Mojaddidi. ``The Soviets' efforts to impose a government of their
choice on the Afghan nation will protract the war and kill our
people.''
   Although Mojaddidi ruled out the cease-fire sought by Vorontsov
but promised that Moslem guerrillas, called mujahedeen or Islamic
holy warriors, would not attack departing Soviet soldiers.
   He said Vorontsov was told ``we can only order mujahedeen not to
attack your withdrawing troops. We can give you peace . . . to
pass.''
   The Soviet envoy has said Moscow will meet the February
withdrawal deadline unless departing Soviet soldiers are attacked by
guerrillas.
   ``It could be delayed if there were all out fighting on Soviet
forces, if there were attacks on Soviet forces withdrawing,''
Vorontsov said earlier.
   More than 100,000 Red Army troops moved into Afghanistan in
December 1979 and replaced one pro-Moscow regime with another. In
April, the Kremlin agreed to withdraw its forces by Feb.. Half had
left by August.
   Vorontsov has been on a diplomatic mission since early December,
seeking a political consensus on a broad-based government to step
into the breach following the withdrawal.
   He has met with the Iran- and Pakistan-based guerrilla groups,
which both agree that Najib's ruling party can play no part in a
post-war government. About 3 million Afghan refugees live in
Pakistan, another 2 million in Iran.
   Modaddidi said the decision to break off the talks means fighting
is likely to continue beyond Feb. 15.
   He predicted that the guerrillas' allies, most notably the United
States and Pakistan, will continue their support after the Red Army
leaves and predicted that the current Kabul government will collapse
within months of the final Soviet pullout.
   The Pakistan-based guerrilla alliance, the dominant insurgent
force, has said it plans to form a council that would, at the
collapse of Najib's government, choose a transitional government
from within its ranks.
   Both Pakistan- and Iran-based guerrillas would nominate council
members.

   Residents of three states today struggled
to recover from tornadoes that destroyed a third of the buildings in
this southeastern Illinois town and injured more than four dozen
people.
   ``It looks like this place has been bombed,'' Mayor Jack Loeffler
said Sunday from an emergency command post in a bank.
   Twisters hit the Illinois towns of Mill Shoals, Albion and
Allendale on Saturday afternoon before moving into Indiana and
touching down near Vincennes. Late Saturday, a tornado cut a
two-mile path through the southern Kentucky community of Franklin.
   Fifty people were injured in Illinois, and 22 remained
hospitalized Sunday. The three people injured in Indiana were
released from hospitals by Sunday; no injuries were reported in
Kentucky.
   ``After seeing everything that's happened, we were pretty lucky
no folks were hurt,'' said Simpson County Judge-Executive Ken Harper
in Kentucky.
   The National Guard was sent to the tornado-ravaged areas of
Illinois and Kentucky to help with the cleanup and to prevent
looting.
   Loeffler said the tornado cut through a 10-square-block area of
Allendale, destroying 53 homes and nine businesses, as well as the
post office, fire station, city hall and a school.
   On Sunday, the National Guard and other emergency workers cleared
trees and power lines that had been knocked down and other rubble
from streets, but hadn't made much headway on houses, said Gen.
Donald Lynn.
   Police said people whose homes were destroyed were staying with
friends or relatives in town, and about a dozen were taken to
shelters.
   Shocked officials and residents of this town of 600 assessed the
damage Sunday.
   ``It's a mess is all you can say,'' said Allendale resident Linda
Griesemer. ``Houses are flattened, windows blowed out, roofs gone.''
   A damage estimate was not yet available, Loeffler said.
   Gov. James R. Thompson toured Allendale and flew over the other
affected areas. He said he planned to declare Allendale a state
disaster area.
   ``It's a mess. It's awful,'' Thompson said. The tornado ``not
only took out a third of the homes, it took out almost the entire
downtown and all the public facilities.''
   In Mill Shoals, two or three mobile homes were overturned and a
few homes and farm buildings were damaged. In Albion, five buildings
were damaged but there were no injuries, said Mayor Earl Bailey.
   In Indiana, a twister came within a mile of Vincennes Lincoln
High School, where 2,500 people were watching a junior varsity
basketball game when the storm knocked the school's power out.
   ``People are moving back into their homes and salvaging what they
can,'' Sheriff's Deputy Jerry Reitmeyer said Sunday. ``We were lucky
last night. It didn't rain anymore after the tornado, so not a lot
of homes were water-soaked.
   ``One or two homes are really damaged extensively enough that the
people won't be able to live in them.''
   Five homes were destroyed and 25 were damaged by the tornado that
hit Franklin, Ky.
   ``It came and went so quickly that some people slept through it,
didn't know it had happened,'' Harper said.
   William Huff said he went to his front door to investigate the
booming sounds of the tornado.
   ``I opened the front door, and the next thing I know, the house
was gone,'' Huff said. His two-bedroom house was leveled.

   David O. Dodd took his secrets to the
grave after he was hanged at age 17 for being a Confederate spy 125
years ago.
   A coded message detailing Union positions around Little Rock
after the city fell to Union troops in September 1863 was found in
his boot.
   But Dodd refused to answer questions or testify at a
court-martial.
   Dodd was convicted of spying for the Confederacy and hanged Jan.
8, 1864.
   On Sunday, Civil War enthusiasts gathered at Dodd's plot in Mount
Holly Cemetery to mark the 125th anniversary of his execution. About
40 people _ half in Civil War dress _ stood in the cold as William
W. O'Donnell of Little Rock, author of articles about Dodd,
proclaimed him the ``Boy Martyr of the Confederacy.''
   ``It's a story of unbounded courage,'' O'Donnell said.
   A crowd of 6,000, some of whom walked across the frozen Arkansas
River, witnessed Dodd's hanging near downtown Little Rock. The
execution took five minutes, and wasn't over until a Union soldier
climbed the gallows to jerk the rope, O'Donnell said.
   ``Dodd was one of the youngest ever executed as a spy,'' said
Jerry Russell, a member of the Civil War Roundtable of Arkansas.
   Dodd's fate began to unravel in late December 1863. He traveled
south from Little Rock, surrendering his pass to get through a Union
roadblock. After spending the night with a relative, Dodd headed
back toward the occupied city.
   ``The Union lines had moved out a couple of miles the next day.
Since Dodd had surrendered his pass, he couldn't get through,''
Russell said.
   ``There wasn't a real tight ring of steel around the town. He
might have gotten through with his information. If Dodd had really
been the sneaky type, he would have gone through the woods.
Apparently, he was not sneakily inclined, and thought he could go
through the roadblock.''
   The offer to betray his allies was extended to Dodd by Gen.
Frederick Steele, who, ``in his written reports, felt really bad
about it. He was very anguished over this thing, but they could not
condone spying,'' Russell said.
   Dodd also wouldn't tell why he was carrying the message, which
was in Morse code. ``Why did he do it? Why? He never told anybody,''
O'Donnell said. ``He never took the stand in his own defense. How
could a 17-year-old have so much courage to face the gallows without
trying to escape?''
   In a letter to his family on the day he died, Dodd wrote, ``I was
arrested as a Spy and tried, and Sentenced to be hung today at 3
o'clock. The time is fast approaching but thank God I am prepared to
die. I expect to meet you all in heaven. Do not weep for me for I
will be better off in heaven.''
   On Sunday, the Lord's Prayer and a 21-gun salute echoed in the
windswept cemetery. Seconds passed between each of the three volleys
as seven riflemen reloaded their black-powder weapons.
   Anthony Rushing, 26, of West Memphis, who wore a gray Civil War
coat in the ceremony's color guard, said his image of Dodd comes as
much from the heart as from the history books.
   ``He was done an injustice. I think they were trying to make an
example of him. He was a hero,'' Rushing said.

   It was confession time for NBC Entertainment
President Brandon Tartikoff as he put his hand on a stack of Bibles
carried by an actor dressed as a priest.
   Yes, Tartikoff confessed, it probably was a bad idea to broadcast
Geraldo Rivera's special on Satanism, which was picked up by the
entertainment division after news side refused to touch it with a
10-foot pitch fork.
   ``I would not say it was our finest hour,'' Tartikoff told a
gathering of newspaper writers and critics Saturday after staging
the stunt with the Bibles, at which he also vowed not to buy a
sequel to Vanna White's ``Goddess of Love.''
   Tartikoff said specials like November's ``Devil Worship: Exposing
Satan's Underground,'' which featured gruesome reports of torture,
child sexual abuse and baby skinning, are best left to the world of
syndication.
   ``I don't think you'll be seeing more programs like than from
NBC,'' he said.
   Tartikoff said the network didn't know far enough in advance that
Rivera's material would be so graphic.
   ``He did not come in saying, `I've got something you're going to
love _ skinning babies,''' Tartikoff said.
   NBC President and Chief Executive Robert Wright, however, said he
remains unrepentant about the Satanism special.
   Wright echoed Rivera's own defense of the program, calling the
topic ``exciting and newsworthy.''

   Emperor Akihito today set the tone for his reign by
pledging to work for peace and preserve Japanese democracy, but said
he faced ``awesome responsibilities'' after the death of his father,
Hirohito.
   The four-minute speech was Akihito's first public statement since
he ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne when Hirohito died of cancer
Saturday at age 87. It was delivered at the Imperial Palace during a
simple ceremony attended by Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and 237
other dignitaries.
   Outside, hundreds of thousand of Japanese streamed past to pay
their respects to Hirohito, who reigned for 62 years.
   ``Shrouded in sorrow and overwhelmed by the awesome
responsibilities I undertake, I stand humble before you,'' said
Akihito, who was clad in a black cutaway and gray trousers.
   ``I pledge myself to continue in the spirit of his late majesty,
making his desire to constantly be at one with the people my desire
as well, joining together with you to preserve the constitution of
Japan, and thereby execute my duties faithfully,'' he added.
   Japan's post-war constitution, which bans the emperor from any
role in government and limits him to ceremonial functions, formed
the basis for the country's democracy. It limits the emperor's role
to signing bills into law and serving as ``symbol of the state and
the unity of the people.''
   ``I do fervently desire the further development of Japan, peace
on Earth and enhanced well-being for all peoples,'' Akihito said.
   He spoke clearly and solemnly, with the new Empress Michiko, 54,
on his left wearing a black dress and veil and their son, Crown
Prince Naruhito, 28, on his right.
   By Japanese tradition, Akihito's statement was his first Imperial
Rescript, in which a new emperor sets a tone for his reign.
   The rite, in the palace's main ceremonial hall, was an important
milestone in the transition to Akihito's new imperial era of Heisei,
or ``Achieving Peace.''
   On Sunday, Hirohito's body was wrapped in a white cloth and
placed in a coffin made of Japanese cypress at the palace in
preparation for the Feb. 24 burial. Representatives of more than 130
countries, including up to 50 heads of state or government, are
expected to attend.
   Hirohito's era, called Showa, or ``Enlightened Peace,'' ended
with his death, and according to Japanese tradition he becomes known
as Emperor Showa. His reign stretched from Japan's descent into
militarism and defeat in World War II to its impressive recovery
into an economic superpower.
   Thousands of police were deployed today to prevent violence by
radical leftist and rightist groups, for whom the emperor embodies
Japanese militarism and nationalism.
   Hirohito was revered as a living god until he was forced to
renounce his divinity at the end of World War II, and Japanese
soldiers fought and died during the war in the monarch's name.
   Two old soldiers have hanged themselves since learning of
Hirohito's passing, saying in suicide notes that they wanted to
follow the emperor in death. An 87-year-old former army man hanged
himself Saturday, and the body of a former navy officer was found
Sunday hanging from a tree in a temple compound.
   Mourners continued to stream to the palace today to sign
condolence registers outside the main gate. On Sunday, the palace
said 438,376 people braved drizzling rain to honor the late emperor
at the palace, and the number of signers today had reached 223,020
by 3:30 p.m.
   Japan's stock market today boomed to a record high closing and
its biggest gain in a year in the first session since Hirohito's
death.
   A dealer at Nomura Securities said small investors were drawn
back into the market after the emperor's death.
   ``During his three-month-long illness, many individual investors
were extremely cautious and anxious about what might happen when the
emperor died,'' said Michio Katsumata. ``But that's over now.''

strapped to Oller's back in a formation in which the instructor
holds the controls to their common harness and parachute, Metro-Dade
police spokeswoman Lucy Fitts said.
   A reserve parachute also failed to open, authorities said.
   The victims were the last of five passengers to jump out of a
plane that took off from Homestead General Aviation Airport in
southwest Dade County, Ms. Fitts said.
   Oller's age was not available.

adapted from Milan Kundera's novel, was voted the 1988's best
picture by the National Society of Film Critics.
   The film, about a Czech surgeon who flees his homeland when the
Soviets invade in 1968, mixes politics and eroticism. Its director,
Philip Kaufman, was honored Sunday by the society with the best
director award.
   Other winners were:
   Actor: Michael Keaton, ``Beetlejuice'' and ``Clean and Sober.''
   Actress: Judy Davis, ``High Tide.''
   Supporting Actor: Dean Stockwell, ``Married to the Mob'' and
``Tucker.''
   Supporting Actress: Mercedes Ruehl, ``Married to the Mob.''
   Documentary: ``The Thin Blue Line,'' by Errol Morris.
   Screenplay: Ron Shelton, ``Bull Durham.''
   Cinematography: Henri Alekan, ``Wings of Desire.''
   The society voted a special award to Pedro Almodovar, director of
``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' and ``Matador,'' ``for

   A man says he didn't pay much attention to
the bones his dog had been bringing home for the past two months
until the animal retrieved a human skull.
   The dog brought home the skull Saturday afternoon, and
authorities are treating the case as a homicide, said police
spokesman Mark Mann.
   Mann said efforts to recover the body and find clues were
hampered by snow, rain, low temperatures, and damage to the
scattered remains by dogs.
   The bones found near a city water pumphouse in northeast Tacoma
Saturday and Sunday have limited value in solving the case, police
said.
   But the skull had lots of dental work, which may help in
identifying the victim.
   Mary DeTracy, medical investigator with the Pierce County Medical
Examiner's Office, said the victim could be identified by Wednesday,
after the teeth are compared with dental records of missing persons
filed with the state patrol.
   Jim Farrell said his dog, Duke, began bringing home bones about
two months ago.
   He said he tossed most of bones in a nearby gully until Saturday
afternoon, when Duke brought home the skull.
   Most of the bones were found Sunday morning behind the pumphouse,
about 100 yards from Farrell's home, Mann said.

<HEAD>Broadway's ``42nd Street'' Closes After Eight Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dancing feet of the cast of ``42nd Street''
took to the stage one last time, as the second longest-running show
on Broadway closed after eight years and 3,486 performances seen by
10 million people.
   Based on the 1933 Warner Bros. movie starring Ruby Keeler, Dick
Powell and Ginger Rogers, the show told the tale of a chorus girl
replacing an aging star who breaks her ankle just before opening
night.
   It closed on Sunday but it may be revived in April with an
all-black cast, and the scenery and other equipment is being kept.
   Its music includes such classics as ``Lullaby of Broadway,''
``Shuffle Off to Buffalo,'' and the title song.
   The musical's longevity was second only to ``A Chorus Line,''
which opened in 1975.
   ``42nd Street'' won the 1981 Tony Award for best musical, and its
director and choreographer, Gower Champion, won a posthumous Tony
for choreography.
   Champion died just hours before the opening-night performance in
New York on Aug. 25, 1980. He was 59 and had a rare form of blood
cancer.
   Few involved in putting on the musical had known of Champion's
illness, and the cast and audience were not informed of his death
until after the final curtain, when producer David Merrick announced
it from the stage.
   Merrick, now 77, suffered a stroke six years ago that makes it
difficult for him to speak.
   ``It's been a wonderful opportunity to have brought this
extravaganza to Broadway and I take pride in the fact that it has
been seen by 10 million people,'' Merrick said through his attorney.
   Merrick watched the final show from the audience and he posted a
letter backstage to thank the cast and crews for ``your brilliant
talents, your dedication, your boundless energies and caring, and
your total professionalism.''
   He has produced more than 80 Broadway shows, including ``Hello,
Dolly'' and ``Play It Again, Sam.''
   ``42nd Street'' opened with a cast of 54 that included Tammy
Grimes, Jerry Orbach, Wanda Richert and Lee Roy Reams. It closed
Sunday starring Elizabeth Allen, Jamie Ross, Jim Walton and Clare
Leach.
   Thirteen cast members had been in the show since opening night.
There have been six marriages within the company and six babies born.
   The musical played at three theaters: the Winter Garden, the
Majestic and the St. James, where its final performance was played.

   A Pan Am jumbo jet made an emergency landing this
morning at Heathrow Airport after the pilot reported problems with
its hydraulic landing gear, officials said. There were no reports of
injuries.
   Fire engines and ambulances lined the runway as the Boeing 747,
carrying about 200 people from Washington, D.C. to London, landed
safely shortly after 7 a.m. (2 a.m. EST).
   ``He radioed ahead and the airport was put on alert,'' said an
airport spokeswoman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom. ``In any event, it landed without significant problems.''
   The plane's flight number was not given.

<TEXT>
   The 12-week-old jetliner that crashed in England
was the first involving a Boeing 737-400, a model introduced last
year, a Boeing Co. spokesman said.
   The British Midland Airways jet, carrying 126 people, crashed
Sunday while attempting an emergency landing about 10 minutes after
leaving London's Heathrow Airport en routeto Belfast. Authorities
said at least 37 people were killed.
   Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said the aircraft was purchased last
fall by GPA Leasing in Shannon, Ireland, which leased it to British
Midland. He said it is the first accident involving a 737-400 or a
737-300, which is 10 feet shorter than the 400 series.
   The 737-400 was certified by the Federal Aviation Administration
in September and 17 of the $28 million to $32 million jets are in
use, Gamble said Sunday.
   British Midland chairman Michael Bishop said the company had
taken delivery of the twin-engine plane only 12 weeks ago. He said
the plane reported severe vibrations in one of the engines about
eight minutes into the flight. Witnesses said one of the engines was
on fire as it attempted to land at an airport about 100 miles north
of London.
   Gamble said the engine used on both 737 models is the CFM-56,
which is built in France by a consortium made up of General Electric
and SMECMA, a French concern.
   He said the engines are brought to the United States and
reassembled and tested at a General Electric plant near Cincinnati.
The completed engines are shipped to the Boeing plant at Renton, a
suburb of Seattle, where the 737 is manufactured.
   The CFM-56 has been the world's top-selling commercial jet engine
during the past two years surpassing GE's rival, Pratt &amp; Whitney
Aircraft, in the market for powering standard-body jets of
short-to-medium-range routes.
   More than 5,900 of the engines have been sold to more than 100
operators since the engine entered service in 1982.
   Dwight E. Weber, a spokesman for CFM International and the GE
aircraft engine business group, declined to speculate on the role
the CFM-56 may have played in Sunday's crash.
   ``We'll be working with the airline to determine the cause,''
Weber said Sunday. ``Once the cause is determined, if it's
engine-related, we'll be working with the customers who operate the
engine to determine if it's an isolated case or a fleetwide
program.''
   A Boeing team was to travel to England today aboard a 737-300
that was being delivered to British Midland, said David Jimenez,
another Boeing spokesman.
   The 737-400 was rolled out in January 1988, and the first flight
was in March. Depending on the interior design, the jet can seat 130
to 150 passengers.

   Assailants hurled two grenades into a
crowd attending award ceremonies at a basketball tournament, killing
at least 13 people and injuring 78 in the southern Philippines, the
military said today.
   Lt. Anselmo Cabingan, a military spokesman, said authorities had
no indication of who was responsible for Sunday night's attack at a
basketball court in Esperanza, a remote town about 600 miles south
of Manila.
   About 1,000 people, many of them children, were attending the
tournament when the attack ocurred, said Sgt. Joven Astrero of the
operations section of the Philippine Constabulary in Cotabato City,
about 40 miles from Esperanza, which is in Sultan Kudarat province.
   Astrero said the tournament had just ended and the town's mayor,
Romulo Latog Sr., was awarding trophies when the blasts occurred.
Latog and his son, Romulo Jr., were among the injured, he said.
   The government-run Philippines News Agency agency, quoting a
local radio station, put the death toll at 26 people, mostly
children.
   Astrero said there were conflicting reports on the casualty
figure but it appeared the agency count was too high. Astrero could
not confirm how many children were killed.

   A U.S. soldier was slightly injured
today when a group of protesters hurled firebombs at an American
military base in the southern city of Taegu, police and U.S.
authorities said.
   A U.S. military spokesman said the attackers hurled seven
firebombs at Camp Henry in the city 180 miles south of Seoul.
   The American soldier was hurt when a firebomb was hurled through
the windshield of the jeep he was driving, the spokesman said. The
firebomb did not explode, but the soldier was cut by flying glass,
he said.
   U.S. authorities said they did not know why the base was
attacked, but the camp and other American bases in South Korea have
been attacked in recent months by radical students demanding the
withdrawal of U.S. troops.
   Police said today's attack involved five or six youths who
identified themselves as ``patriotic students in Taegu'' in the
leaflets they scattered. Police reported no arrest.
   Police said the leaflets contained criticism of last Wednesday's
downing by U.S. warplanes of two Libyan fighters over the
Mediterranean Sea.
   It was the second attack on Camp Henry in a month. Radical
students chanting anti-U.S. slognas firebombed the camp on Dec. 27,
cauing a small fire at a building. The fire was quickly extinguished
with no injuries.
   Dissidents and radical students have staged anti-American
protests demanding the withdrawl of some 42,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact against
communist North Korea. They contend U.S. forces in the country help
perpetuate division of the Korean peninsula.
   Korea was split into the communist north and the capitalist south
in 1945, when U.S. and Soviet troops ended Japan's colonial rule
over the peninsula.

<HEAD>Winter Weather Gives South A Chill; Michigan Bridge Closed</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Moist Gulf of Mexico air in tandem with cold air produced a
potpourri of sleet, freezing rain and snow today from the lower
Mississippi Valley across the Tennessee Valley to the central
Appalachians.
   In Michigan, snow combined with winds up to 60 mph Sunday to
reduce visibility on the Mackinac Bridge and forced the Mackinac
Bridge Authority to close the structure to traffic for an hour,
authority spokeswoman Lorraine Garries said.
   ``We didn't get much accumulation, it was just blowing,'' Garries
said, adding it was only the third time in 11 years that the bridge
was forced to shut down because of weather.
   Snowfall totals across Michigan's upper peninsula ranged up to 13
inches, but the lower peninsula had snowfall totaling 1 to 4 inches.
   Wet snow fell in parts of Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi and
Alabama.
   It also settled over the central and southern Appalachians where
2 to 3 inches of snow accumulated. Up to 6 inches of snow was
expected in southern West Virginia, with 8 inches over higher
elevations.
   Winter weather also affected the Northwest today, with snow
falling over eastern parts of the Pacific Northwest, Montana and
Idaho. Between 6 and 12 inches of new snow was expected in parts of
Idaho by tonight.
   Meanwhile, rain fell along the central Pacific coast.
   Strong winds were blowing across the Rockies' east slopes in
Wyoming and Montana. Winds gusted to 60 mph in the upper Yellowstone
River Valley in Montana.
   Much of the nation's midsection was in the grip of a frigid
arctic air mass, with temperatures plummeting below the zero mark in
much of the northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley.
   The frigid air was flowing eastward across the warmer waters of
the lower Great Lakes, creating lake effect snow east of Lake
Ontario and Lake Erie.
   The high Sunday was 86 degrees at Fort Myers, Fla.
   Today's forecast called for rain along much of the Pacific coast
and extending from the western and central Gulf Coast to Tennessee
and North Carolina; snow across the northern Plateau into the
northern Rocky Mountains, and in the mid-Atlantic Coast and the
southern Appalachians; scattered snow showers in the Great Lakes
region; fair to partly sunny skies across the rest of the nation.
   Predicted highs: below freezing from the northern and central
Rockies through the lower and middle Mississippi Valley to New
England; single digits and teens from eastern Montana through
Minnesota and Iowa to the upper Great Lakes; 50 degrees-plus from
the southern and central coast of California through the Rio Grande
Valley of Texas to the southern Atlantic coast, with lower 60s in
Southern California, and 70s and lower 80s in Florida.
   The nation's temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 27 degrees
below zero at Devils Lake, N.D., to 73 at Miami and Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.

<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in Europe this morning, supported
by expectations of higher U.S. interest rates. Gold prices fell.
   Traders said expectations that U.S. interest rates were poised to
rise were fueling the dollar's recent rally, but fears that central
banks may intervene were keeping a lid on the U.S. currency, at
least for the time being.
   Demand was generated mostly by speculative institutional
investors, while corporate clients appeared reluctant to commit
themselves to the dollar's recent advance, traders said.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7670, compared with
$1.7797 Friday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday:
   _1.8265 West German marks, up from 1.8140
   _1.5575 Swiss francs, up from 1.5475
   _6.2265 French francs, up from 6.1830
   _2.0595 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0480
   _1,339.00 Italian lire, up from 1,330.50
   _1.1965 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1912
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.11 yen to a closing 126.08 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 126.55 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $406.40 a troy ounce, up
from $405.75 bid late Friday. But at midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a lower recommended price of
$404.45.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $404.80, down from $405.50 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.97 to close at a bid $407.18.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.97 a troy ounce,
unchanged from Friday's late price.

   Foreign Minister R.F. Botha of South Africa rose to
give a speech today at an international conference on chemical
weapons and most delegates walked out in protest of his country's
apartheid policies.
   Botha then proposed an African conference on poverty.
   ``Chemical weapons are one way to die. Thirst and hunger is
another,'' he told the delegates who remained in the nearly empty
hall. They included the U.S. contingent.
   Before the speech, Foreign Minister Robert Ouko of Kenya rose and
declared:
   ``The regime in this hall does not represent the people of South
Africa. Africa will leave the hall when the clique rises to speak.''
   Most all African delegations and numerous other Soviet bloc,
Asian and Latin American delegates then cleared the hall. Only 20 of
the 150 delegations remained.
   In addition to an African meeting on poverty, Botha proposed a
conference to declare Africa a chemical weapon-free zone and to
resist Western efforts to dump toxic wastes on the continent.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no say in
national affairs and have separate schools, neighborhoods and
medical facilities. The government is controlled by the country's 5
million whites.

<TEXT>
   With the Super Bowl less than two weeks away,
brokers are busy selling ticket packages for as much as $20,000 for
the football extravaganza.
   That's the going price for an air-conditioned skybox seating nine
at the 75,000-seat Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami where the Super Bowl
will be played Jan. 22.
   ``It's like an apartment,'' said Raquel Barouh, who is fielding
inquiries for the $20,000 skybox offering. ``It's worth the price.''
   The National Football League doles out Super Bowl tickets to the
league's 28 teams, with the most going to the competing teams and
the host city. The teams decide how to distribute their allotment.
   The NFL forbids the sale of tickets for a premium, and scalping
is illegal in Florida, noted James Steeg, NFL special events
coordinator.
   That makes individual ticket sellers reluctant to talk about
their offerings, but brokers who package the tickets with hotel
stays, buffets and transportation aren't so shy.
   ``We're offering $500 a seat,'' said Jerry Adelman of Murray's
Tickets in Los Angeles, where there are no restrictions on ticket
resales. ``We'll probably handle up to 3,500 seats.''
   The agency is offering a three-day package for $1,025, but
Adelman says, ``I'd rather go to Hawaii myself.''
   The Cincinnati Bengals and the San Francisco 49ers won decisive
conference championships Sunday to advance to the Super Bowl and a
shot at the NFL title.
   The Bengals, who lost the Super Bowl in 1982 to the 49ers,
defeated Buffalo 21-10 to win the American Football Conference. The
49ers beat the Chicago Bears 28-3 for the National Football
Conference title.
   Larry Reader, a salesman who lives near Indianapolis, bought 10
tickets for customers, paying $500 for six seats in the end zone and
$850 apiece for four seats on the 25-yard line.
   Wendy Lester of Miami wrote in a classified ad appeal: ``Help my
brother and I get to our first Super Bowl.''
   She ended up spending $1,000 on two tickets.
   ``It seems the things you want to do get more expensive as you
get older,'' she said.
   For $15,000, a dentist is offering four end-zone Super Bowl
tickets, a week's stay at a country club condominium and a Cadillac
for transportation.
   Dr. Ron Marx of Hollywood hasn't gotten any takers yet on his
classified ad, but he's been getting plenty of inquiries.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' he said. ``These people will pay anything.
I've been getting calls from all over the country.''
   Marx is even willing to kick in a little extra.
   ``If people really push, I might even pick them up at the
airport,'' he said, adding he has received at least a dozen phone
calls and already has the proceeds spent.
   ``I figure I can put my kid through one year of Brown University
on this,'' Marx said.

   The neglect of today's children could
lead to deficiencies in tomorrow's work force, Lt. Gov. Marlene
Johnson of Minnesota warned participants in the second Women's
Agenda Conference.
   In the concluding session of the conference Sunday, participants
also were asked for a renewed commitment to maintaining legalized
abortion and the development of a national coalition.
   Johnson said a lack of adequate child care kept many parents from
participating in the economy.
   Ms. Johnson also said there was a need for women in leadership
positions and called on her listeners to work to develop leaders
from within their ranks.
   ``We need to keep fighting the battles,'' she said. ``But we also
need to keep nurturing each other to become stronger and more
effective in the larger community.''
   The conference, organized by the National Federation of Business
and Professional Women's Clubs, began Friday. It was sponsored by
more than 50 organizations nationwide.
   Dolly Adams of the Black Women's Agenda encouraged the
development of a national women's coalition. She said such a group
would need to have a larger vision than those of the individual
organizations involved.
   Other issues discussed Sunday included poverty among older women,
the need to bring divorced and widowed women into the work place,
and the possibility of a renewed campaign for an Equal Rights
Amendment.
   Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League, said that if abortion rights are abridged,
``1989 could be the year that women were put back in their place.''
   ``We are in danger right now of losing our vital right to decide
whether to have a child or not and under what circumstances,'' she
said.
   Ms. Michelman told the audience that the 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision by the Supreme Court occurred against the backdrop of the
women's movement.
   ``We instructed the court,'' she said. ``We became their
conscience. We created the context for Roe to happen.''
   Ms. Michelman urged the women to speak out and create a renewed
climate of activism for the pro-abortion movement.
   ``You have to go out of here absolutely committed,'' she said.
``I plead with you to be a part of millions of voices, silent no
longer.''

<HEAD>Shevardnadze To Visit Beijing in Early February</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will
visit Beijing in early February to prepare for a China-Soviet
summit, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen of China said today.
   Qian is in Paris for an international conference on chemical
weapons.
   This year's planned summit between Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping would be the first in 30
years.
   Chinese and Soviet leaders last met in 1959 in Beijing when Mao
Tse-tung held talks with Soviet Communist Party chief Nikita
Khrushchev.
   Beijing and Moscow were close in the 1950s, but the two countries
split in 1960 over ideological differences and fought a brief border
war in 1969.
   Chinese national television said today that Shevardnadze and Qian
also will discuss Cambodia and other issues during their February
meeting.
   In December, Qian visited Moscow, the first time a Chinese
foreign minister had been to the Soviet capital in 30 years. The
trip appeared to be the first step toward normalizing relations
between the countries.

   Kids can sure make a mess. But admittedly,
4-year-old Ian Loizeaux made a bigger mess than most.
   One push of a button by the preschooler Sunday brought an
eight-story building in downtown Baltimore crashing down to ruin.
   Doug Loizeaux, 38, says he just wanted his son to try his hand at
the family business.
   Loizeaux is co-owner of Controlled Demolition Inc. The founder of
the business, his father Jack Loizeaux, also was on hand to see the
havoc wreaked by his grandson.
   The button that Ian had pushed set off 347 pounds of explosives
that had been carefully placed in 560 locations throughout the
building so that the building would topple safely.
   ``Absolutely perfect! I'm so proud of you. Everything moved just
right,'' said the elder Loizeaux, 73.
   The boy watched in silence as the Falconer Building, which housed
printing businesses for seven decades, vanished in an avalanche of
dust. Its place will be taken by an 11-story parking garage.
   Ian's uncle, J. Mark Loizeaux, president and co-owner of the
company, said he got his own start demolishing buildings at a young
age.
   ``I started at 8,'' he said. ``That was the only time we ever saw
our dad, by going to work with him.'' He and his brother Doug, who
have six children between them ranging, say they hope to see a third
generation take over the business.
   The work is ``instant gratification,'' Doug Loizeaux said. ``You
know if you're a hero or a bum in about eight seconds.''

<HEAD>Scotland Yard Offers Apology In Body Mix-Up, Father Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British investigator offered ``a
wholehearted apology'' for sending the wrong body to a family whose
daughter died aboard the Pan Am jet crash in Lockerbie, Scotland,
the young woman's father says.
   Robert Hunt said he met with a Scotland Yard official Sunday
afternoon at the Hunts' home in the Rochester suburb of Webster. His
20-year-old daughter, Karen, was among the 259 people killed aboard
Flight 103 when it exploded over Lockerbie last month.
   The British police official and an FBI agent spoke to the Hunts
after the Monroe County Medical Examiner's Office determined through
dental records and X-rays Saturday that the remains sent to the
family were not those of Karen Hunt.
   Ms. Hunt, a student at Syracuse University, would have celebrated
her 21st birthday Saturday.
   ``The British official just wanted to apologize,'' Hunt said.
``He offered a wholehearted apology and promised they were doing
everything possible to rectify the situation.''
   ``They really wouldn't commit to anything else,'' he said. ``I
got the feeling they don't want to tell us anything unless they're
100 percent sure.''
   He said he didn't know the name or title of the Scotland Yard
official.
   Gregory Jones, an FBI spokesman in Washington, confirmed that a
British police official met with Hunt, but said he had no details on
the misidentification. Jones said he didn't know what will be done
with the body sent to the Hunts.
   Officials in Washington ``have no idea'' where Ms. Hunt's body
is, Jones said.
   Karen Hunt was returning to New York after completing a
one-semester program in Syracuse University's Division of
International Programs Abroad in London. She was one of 35 such
students to die in the crash.

<DATELINE>KEGWORTH, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators today recovered the flight
recorders from the wreckage of a new Boeing 737 that crashed along a
highway after one engine, and possibly both, failed. At least 43
people were killed and 83 injured.
   Firefighters pumped foam onto the crumpled jet to prevent seeping
aviation fuel from catching fire. The Belfast-bound jet carrying 126
people broke into three pieces on the edge of Britain's main
north-south highway, the M1, in central England on Sunday night.
   The twin-engine Boeing 737-400 narrowly missed the small town of
Kegworth and plowed into an embankment just a few hundred yards
short of the runway as the pilot struggled to make an emergency
landing at East Midland Airport, 100 miles north of London.
   One engine was on fire, and Transport Secretary Paul Channon said
it ``certainly looks probable'' there was a problem with the second
engine.
   British Midland Airways said sabotage was not suspected in the
crash, which came less than three weeks after a bomb blew apart Pan
Am Flight 103 over a Scottish village, Lockerbie, killing all 259
people on board and 11 on the ground.
   Witnesses and a radio operator who monitored the pilot's final
exchanges with air traffic controllers Sunday also said both engines
appeared to have failed.
   British Midland said the jet was delivered just 12 weeks ago and
had flown less than 500 hours. It grounded its other 737-400 for
inspection.
   ``At the moment it does seem to be a technical problem,'' said
Paul Beaver, a managing editor of aviation for Jane's publications.
``I think they have ruled out pilot error and almost definitely
ruled out sabotage.''
   Beaver, interviewed on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,'' said
the chances of both engines failing were ``something like a 10
million to one chance, and of course sometimes those chances come
up.''
   At least four British soldiers serving in Northern Ireland were
among the 43 killed, police said.
   ``It's amazing'' no motorists or nearby residents were killed,
Leicestershire Assistant Chief Constable Tony Butler told a news
conference today. ``It's a very busy road.''
   Channon said the fast response of emergency services saved lives.
   ``The airport fire brigade was there within minutes ... a number
of people are living as a result.''
   Police said the last person was taken from the wreckage more than
seven hours after the crash. They said it took 2{ hours to extract
the pilot, Kevin Hunt. A spokeswoman for the Leicester Royal
Infirmary said Hunt was in poor condition with multiple injuries.
   The plane took off from London's Heathrow Airport at 7:52 p.m.,
and about eight minutes later reported ``severe vibrations in one of
the engines,'' said airline chairman Michael Bishop.
   The pilot reported an engine on fire, then said he had it under
control and asked for clearance to make an emergency landing at East
Midlands Airport, the airline's home base 100 miles north of London.
   Witnesses said the left engine was on fire as the plane crashed
about a half-mile shy of the runway. Ham radio operator Mervyn
Solloway said that from what he could hear, both engines were in
trouble.
   ``Suddenly there was, not a shouted message, but a bit of a
frantic one to say, `We've got problems with the other engine.' That
was the last I heard from the aircraft,'' he said.
   The aircraft sheared tree tops and plowed into a steep embankment
by the M1 highway outside the town of Kegworth. A piece of the jet
lodged in the highway divider and bodies and personal belongings
spilled from the plane.
   Motorists swerved in terror and some cars collided, police said.
The tail section embedded in the ground while the fuselage tore
apart, the nose section coming to rest in a bramble thicket.
   Dozens of fire engines, ambulances, residents and motorists
rushed to the scene. The engine fire was quickly extinguished, and
rescuers cut passengers loose. Surgeons performed amputations on the
spot.
   A local Episcopal vicar, the Rev. Michael Brandon, recited the
Lord's Prayer as a man died, clutching his hand.
   ``The whole plane is carnage,'' said Vic Milner, an Automobile
Association worker. ``People were strapped into their seats, dead in
the tangled body of the plane.''
   Several people in Kegworth, a town of 2,000 residents, said that
when the plane crashed, their first thought was of Lockerbie, the
little Scottish town that bore the brunt of the crash of Pan Am
Flight 103 on Dec. 21.
   All 259 people aboard that Boeing 747 were killed, along with 11
Lockerbie residents. Investigators said a bomb blew up the plane.
   In Sunday's crash, ``there nothing to indicate (sabotage)
whatsoever,'' said the airline's marketing director, Colin Roberts.
   David Learmount of the respected journal Flight International
said the British Midland plane must have developed ``more than just
a simple engine failure or the pilot could have gotten the plane
down safely.''
   He told British Broadcasting Corp. television said the Boeing
737-400 has ``the most brilliant safety record in the world today.''
   ``If an airplane's engine catches fire one of the reasons why is
that the engine, which has very fast spinning parts, literally
breaks apart and bits come out through the casing and this can cause
a fire,'' he said.
   In Seattle, Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said Sunday's crash was
the first involving a 737-400. The model had its first flight in
March and airlines are flying 17 of the jets, he said.

   Carrie Munson, a social worker who staged and
attended her own mock funeral 2{ months ago, has died of cancer of
the pancreas. She was 62.
   Munson had said she held the mock funeral, which drew nationwide
attention, to celebrate life and show that she did not fear death.
She died Sunday.
   The Rev. R.L. Lathan, who delivered the eulogy at the memorial
service in October, said two companies have been seeking the right
to publish the biography of Munson, who struggled to overcome heroin
addiction and became a social worker. An independent filmmaker is
also pursuing the rights to a movie about her life.
   ``She wanted to prove to the coming generation that the evils of
drugs could be defeated,'' Lathan said. ``That's what kept her so
fired up to fight it. She was real determined.''
   She had been diagnosed as having inoperable cancer of the
pancreas in October 1987.
   Munson said at the time of her mock funeral that she had been
addicted to drugs for years before turning her life around and
earning a degree from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1975.

<HEAD>Five Seeking Democrats' Chairman Job Meet With Southern Leaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All five candidates for chairman of the Democratic
National Committee played to their Southern audience at a weekend
meeting, with the stress on luring moderate and conservative
Southern whites back to the party.
   The five candidates met about 100 committee members and party
activists Sunday.
   ``I don't want to run a party that writes off the South,'' said
Washington lawyer Ronald H. Brown, who has served in top party posts
and served as Jesse Jackson's 1988 convention manager. ``It doesn't
make sense. You can't do it that way.''
   Brown and Michigan party Chairman Richard N. Wiener, who is
president of the Association of State Democratic Chairs, are
considered favorites. But neither candidate has a majority of the
404-member DNC, and party leaders believe one of three dark horses
could win the Feb. 10 election.
   They are former Reps. Michael D. Barnes of Maryland, James R.
Jones of Oklahoma and James V. Stanton of Ohio.
   While many party chairmen in the West and Midwest have rallied
around Wiener, most Southern chairmen have remained uncommitted.
   Much of the talk Sunday concerned changing the public's
perception of the Democratic message. President-elect George Bush
swept the South in the November elections, just as most Republican
candidates have done for a generation.
   ``The perception is that we are to the left, are much more
liberal, than the mainstream voters,'' Jones said. ``Unless and
until we recognize that, unless and until we bring the party to a
position that is viewed as centrist and representing the vast
majority of this very diverse country, we're not going to win
elections.''
   Jones advocated a three-year advertising campaign that would
attempt to ``make it respectable to be a Democrat again.''
   Wiener said Republicans have put six hurdles in the path of
Democrats running for president: the issues of national defense,
patriotism, crime, gun control, school prayer and abortion.
   ``We don't have to be to the right of the Republicans on those
issues,'' he said. ``But we need to pass a certain threshold on
those issues.''
   He suggested imitating the GOP practice of spending heavily on
issues research, to identify Democratic strengths and Republican
weaknesses.
   Southerners remained uncommitted after the meeting.
   James Van Hecke Jr., the North Carolina party chairman, said the
Southern chairmen may hold a telephone conference later this week to
explore the possibility of a group endorsement.
   Several of the Southern party leaders in the audience said they
appreciated the lip service paid to regional concerns but heard few
specific solutions.
   ``Everybody has said to us for years that the South is the key,
and not one of these candidates disagreed,'' said Alan Diamonstein,
chairman of the DNC's Southern caucus. ``But you can't keep saying
that mathematically the South is the key while not saying how to do
anything about it.''

   Here is the text of the budget message which
President Reagan sent to Congress on Monday.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>To the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President
of the Senate:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Eight years ago many in this country were concerned about the
future of our economy, our government and, indeed, the nation itself.
   Unemployment was high and rising.
   Inflation and interest rates were reaching record levels.
   Our nation's defense capabilities had been weakened by neglect.
   The international prestige of the U.S. was at low ebb.
   To resolve the economic problems then facing us, our
administration proposed a recovery program centering on four
fundamental principles:
   _Reduce personal and business tax rates.
   _Reduce the rate of growth of federal spending.
   _Reduce the federal regulatory burden by eliminating unnecessary
restrictions while protecting the public's interest and safety.
   _Support a moderate and steady monetary policy to bring inflation
under control.
   To rebuild our defense capabilities and restore America's
standing in the world we proposed expanded national security and
international programs.
   We also initiated the largest management improvement program ever
attempted in order to restore the proper relationships among the
federal, state and local governments, and the private sector; to
eliminate waste in federal programs; and to introduce management
controls and efficiencies, while improving services.
   Today, the American people can be proud of the progress that has
been made on each of these fronts.
   As a result of this progress, America is internally stronger,
internationally more secure, and stands taller in the eyes of the
world than it did eight years ago.

<TEXT>
   Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem fighters
recaptured villages in south Lebanon today from pro-Iranian rivals.
Police reported ``horrific massacres'' and said at least 80 people
were killed in a 24-hour period.
   The Amal militia claimed its fighters had overrun four of five
villages seized Sunday by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of
God.
   But reporters who drove into the battle zone near Israel's
self-designated ``security zone'' on Lebanon's southern border said
Amal had retaken only three villages. Fierce fighting raged around
the other two.
   Police said at least 80 people had been killed and 200 wounded
since Sunday morning.
   A police spokesman in Sidon said many victims had been hacked to
death.
   ``Others had their throats cut and some were headless. Many were
riddled with bullets,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be named
under standing regulations. ``Horrific massacres have been
committed.''
   The casualties were the highest 24-hour toll since the power
struggle for Lebanon's 1 million Shiites, the country's largest
sect, flared in April. The latest round of battles began Dec. 31.
   Amal claimed its fighters recaptured four of the villages along
the main road from Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, to Israel's
security zone on Lebanon's southern border.
   Reporters said Amal drove Hezbollah out of the battered villages
of Kfar Hatta, Kfar Melki and Kfar Beit in hand-to-hand fighting
from late Sunday to dawn Monday.
   Amal military commanders in Kfar Melki said about 1,000
militiamen and several Syrian-supplied T-54 tanks were attacking the
other two hamlets, Kfar Filla and Jbaa, where an estimated 500
Hezbollah fighters were holed up.
   Cars hit by rocket-propelled grenades smoldered in the streets of
Kfar Hatta and Kfar Melki, whose 8,000 inhabitants spent the night
hiding in apple and olive groves.
   Aisha Barhoum, 35, found her one-story house in Kfar Melki gutted
when she returned: ``They've burned my house, but God has burned
them in Amal's wrath.''
   As the fighting raged, she said: ``We've been liberated from
Hezbolshaitan.'' That's an Arabic pun on Hezbollah's name, meaning
``Party of Satan.''
   Amal and Hezbollah accused each other of ``atrocities and summary
executions'' in the fighting.
   Iran and Syria, Iran's main Arab ally in the 8-year Iran-Iraq
war, have been trying to rein in their feuding Lebanese proxies but
the fighting has raged despite appeals from President Ali Khamenei
of Iran and Syrian leader Hafez Assad.
   In Beirut, Syrian troops with rocket-propelled grenade launchers
patrolled two neighborhoods where Amal and Hezbollah clashed for two
hours Sunday.
   In April, Amal drove Hezbollah fighters from the south in a
four-day battle in which 62 people were killed and 150 wounded.
   Hezbollah retaliated in May, pushing Amal out of most of Beirut's
southern slums, a traditional Shiite stronghold, in a three-week
onslaught. Nearly 300 people were killed and 1,000 wounded.
   The fighting stopped when Syria, whose army controls security in
Moslem west Beirut, sent 4,500 troops into the slums.
   But the bloodletting broke out again in south Beirut in November
and spilled over into west Beirut. Forty people were killed and 87
wounded in six days of clashes.

   A would-be thief got more than he
bargained for when he trired to rob an elderly couple in a motel
room and was tackled by the man, then chased and captured by a crowd
of tourists, police said.
   Michael Lassiter, 33, of Daytona Beach was being held without
bond today in Volusia County Branch Jail on assault and robbery
charges following the Sunday morning incident.
   According to police, Lassiter entered the motel room of Howard
Douglas, 69, of Milwaukee and his wife, Evelyn, and demanded their
money.
   Douglas leaped out of the bathroom and tackled Lassister, police
said. Meanwhile, Mrs. Douglas yelled to a crowd at the pool deck.
She also took off her rings and threw them to a woman by the pool.
   Lassiter, who is 5-11 and 185 pounds, fled after a brief struggle
with Douglas.
   ``I was 5 feet 7 inches tall and 150 pounds, but when you get
near 70, I think you begin to shrink,'' Douglas said later. ``He
looked big when he was coming at me, but he looked a lot smaller
next to the police.''
   Lassiter reportedly headed toward the beach, with a crowd of
tourists _ including the Douglases' 38-year-old son, Craig _ in
pursuit.
   As Kempton Rothpletz, 24, of Dallas left his car to investigate
the commotion, Lassiter leaped into the vehicle and began to drive
off.
   But Lassiter's bad luck continued as Rothpletz jumped back into
the moving car and managed to force it into several parked cars.
Rothpletz suffered scrapes and bruises to his legs when they were
pinned by the car door, police said.
   Lassiter was captured by the group of tourists as he tried to run
away.
   He was charged with strongarm robbery, auto theft, aggravated
assault and burglary. A check showed that he also was wanted for
armed robbery and theft, police said.

<TEXT>
   Entering college freshmen are getting less aid
from the federal government and are increasingly interested in
making their educations pay off in cold cash, according to a survey
of more than 300,000 students.
   The annual survey nonetheless found that students entering
college in 1988 were more likely than their 1987 counterparts to
want to pursue graduate study despite the financial obstacles.
   And although students are more interested in making money, they
seem less interested in business careers as a means of reaching that
goal, the survey said.
   At the same time, a record proportion of freshmen reported
themselves feeling frequently depressed. Stress over paying for
college and attaining advanced degrees were possible contributing
factors.
   The findings released Sunday by the American Council on Education
and the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of
California at Los Angeles are based on questionnaires filled out by
308,007 freshmen entering 585 two-and four-year colleges and
universities. The results were adjusted to reflect the total
population of 1.64 million first-time, full-time entering students
and have a margin of error of plus or minus two points.
   Only 15.6 percent of freshmen entering school last fall received
Pell grants, the government's major aid program for low- and
middle-income students, the survey found. That was the lowest level
since the survey began 23 years ago and less than half the 31.5
percent who received Pell grants in 1980.
   Freshman participation in other federal aid programs also fell,
while students reported greater reliance on family contributions,
savings, loans and institutional grants.
   The amount of Pell grant aid awarded to students actually rose
nearly 57 percent from 1980 to 1988, or 17 percent taking inflation
into account, according to The College Board, a New York-based
lobbying group.
   But during the same period, the aid was more sharply aimed at the
very neediest post-secondary students, many of whom shun college in
favor of vocational schools that teach cosmetology, art, drama, auto
mechanics, business skills or other trades.
   Victoria Tripp, an Education Department spokeswoman, said 11
percent of Pell money went to vocational students in 1980, compared
with 27 percent in 1988. ``That figure will increase to one-third in
the early 1990s,'' she predicted. ``The money is targeted to those
students and there has been a proliferation of those schools.''
   Despite the falloff in college aid, a record proportion of
freshmen said they were interested in pursuing advanced degrees _
58.7 percent, compared with 48.3 percent in 1980.
   ``The rising degree aspirations suggest that a growing proportion
of students feel the bachelor's degree will not be an adequate
credential in the job market during the next decade and into the
next century,'' said Kenneth C. Green, associate director of the
survey.
   In line with that, a record 72.6 percent of the freshmen
indicated ``making more money'' was a very important factor in their
decision to attend college. By contrast, the proportion who said
they were going to college ``to gain a general education'' declined
for the 11th straight year, to 60.1 percent.
   Examining personal habits, the survey also found that a 22-year
decline in smoking may be reversing itself. In 1966, 16.6 percent of
the freshmen said they were frequent smokers. That fell steadily to
8.9 percent in 1987, but rose to 10.1 percent among those entering
college last fall.
   A record high percentage of freshmen (10.5 percent) said they
frequently felt depressed, while there was no real change in those
rating their emotional health as above average (56.1 percent, as
opposed to 56.8 percent in 1987).
   Survey director Alexander Astin of UCLA said the survey revealed
several potential sources of increased stress for students,
including concern about paying for college; increased interest in
advanced degrees; and tougher competition for admission to selective
institutions.
   On the career front, the survey found that freshman interest in
entering the business world to be leveling off _ 24.6 percent in
1987 and 23.6 percent in 1988 _ after two decades of steady gains.
The results ``suggest that student interest in business careers may
have reached a plateau after the dramatic increases of the 1970s and
1980s,'' survey officials said.
   Student interest in teaching rose from 8.1 percent in 1987 to 8.8
percent in 1988, reflecting a trend that started in 1983 after
interest had bottomed out at 4.7 percent in 1982.
   But interest in science careers, steadily falling in popularity
for the last 20 years, remained low. Only 5.8 percent of the
freshmen said they planned to pursue science majors, compared with 6
percent in 1987 and 11.5 percent in 1973.

<TEXT>
   Iran's foreign minister said today that prospects
for success in Iran-Iraq peace talks are dim, but he said his
country is ready to agree to an international ban on chemical
weapons whether or not Iraq signs.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, attending an international
conference on chemical weapons, said he had met with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to discuss the 8-year-old
Iran-Iraq war.
   A cease-fire began Aug. 20 and negotiations aimed at achieving a
lasting peace began a few days later.
   ``The situation remains volatile and prospects for progress are
dim,'' Velayati told reporters. ``Five months after the cease-fire,
Iraq is still in our territory.''
   Tehran Radio said today, ``The Islamic Republic has always
demonstrated its willingness to participate in the talks, but until
(while) Iraq continues to introduce subterfuges, a resumption of
talks will achieve nothing.''
   The commentary, monitored in Nicosia, gave the strongest
indication yet that Iran may not return to the negotiating table
without guarantees of concrete results.
   The U.N. Security Council and all countries which support its
cease-fire resolution ``must not expect Iran to be optimistic about
the talks until (while) Iraq still refuses to withdraw from Iranian
territory,'' said the broadcast.
   Tehran's accusation that Baghdad is dragging its feet comes
several days after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein claimed Iran was
massing troops along the 730-mile border and probably planning ``new
aggression.'' He also accused Tehran of stalling in the peace talks.
   In Paris, Velayati said Perez de Cuellar is sending high-level
envoys to Baghdad and Tehran soon, and ``we welcome them.''
   Iraq has used chemical weapons, and Velayati called his
countrymen ``the most conspicuous victims'' of violations of the
1925 Geneva Protocol, which bans the use of such weapons. Iraq
admitted using chemical weapons in the war but said Iran used them
first.
   Velayati repeated Iranian claims that his country did not use the
weapons.
   Asked if Iran would be willing to sign an accord expanding the
chemical weapons ban if Iraq refused to sign, Velayati said: ``We
are ready to participate in any global or regional activities on
chemical weapons.''
   Velayati also said he met early today with William Waldegrave,
head of the British delegation, to discuss British hostages being
held in Lebanon.
   He said Iran had been asked for help and that in the past they
had tried to assist ``France, West Germany, even the United States''
in obtaining freedom for hostages held in Lebanon.
   ``We do hope all nationals will be released,'' he said.
   Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are held hostage in
Lebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,
1985.

<DATELINE>NABLUS, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven Palestinians were
reported shot and wounded in clashes with Israeli troops today, and
a general strike shut down the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The daily Haaretz newspaper said Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
had renewed secret contacts with Palestinians to discuss holding
municipal elections in the occupied territories for the first time
since 1976.
   Meetings at Rabin's Tel Aviv office were held in secret to
protect Arab participants from attacks by Palestinian nationalists,
the Hebrew-language paper said.
   The PLO-backed underground leadership of the 13-month uprising
rejected Israeli moves for elections and called for escalation of
the Arab revolt in a leaflet distributed in the territories.
   The army imposed curfews on four Gaza Strip refugee camps and two
neighborhoods of Gaza City and Rafah, confining 135,000 Palestinians
to their homes.
   A military spokesman confirmed four Palestinians were wounded
during clashes with troops in the West Bank refugee camp of Farah,
near Nablus. He said the army was checking other reported casualties.
   Arab hospital officials said two of the wounded were in critical
condition with bullet wounds to the stomach.
   Three other teen-agers were hospitalized with less serious bullet
wounds, according to hospital officials.
   Also today, Arab residents of the West Bank village of Kfar Nakif
threw a firebomb at an Israeli car, which exploded but caused no
damage, Arab reports said. The attack prompted a raid on the village
by a group of Jewish settlers, who threw rocks that damaged two
Palestinian cars, the reports said.
   The army said it was investigating the report.
   In Gaza City, residents hung outlawed Palestinian flags and
photographs of PLO chief Yasser Arafat from electricity lines,
according to Arab reporters.
   Troops used tear gas to break up a demonstration in the West Bank
refugee camp of Dheishe, near Bethlehem, after youths began stoning
soldiers guarding the camp entrance.
   By official count, 348 palestinians and 15 Israelis have been
killed in the uprising.
   The strike call by the PLO-backed leadership came after a
shutdown was ordered by a rival Islamic fundamentalist group, Hamas,
which means ``Zeal'' in Arabic.
   Past Hamas strikes have sparked confrontations with PLO
supporters who demanded merchants not obey the orders. But
Palestinians close to the leadership said the group decided to avoid
confrontation this time.
   ``The United Leadership has started to realize that Hamas has the
power to enforce a strike and they wanted credit for today's
strike,'' said a pro-PLO activist who gave his name only as Ghassan.
   Hamas supporters warned merchants with graffiti in the West Bank
city of Nablus. ``Any merchant who opens his shop will find it
torched to the ground,'' said the warnings painted in red.
   Other slogans signed by Hamas and the extremist Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command criticized recent moves
for a negotiated settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   ``No to negotiation, no to recognition of Israel,'' said one
slogan.

<HEAD>The Federal Deficit</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The one area in which I have been persistently disappointed
throughout my term of office has been in the efforts to bring the
budget under control.
   Time and again I have proposed measures to help curb federal
domestic program spending. Time and again these proposals have been
rejected by Congress.
   The reasons for the rise in the federal deficit in the early
1980s are simple.
   First, we experienced one of the most severe recessions of the
postwar period.
   It has been estimated that 81 percent _ over $640 billion _ of
the growth of the deficit over the 1981-1986 levels originally
projected in my March 1981 budget was attributable to that recession.
   The second reason is that, even after including necessary
increases for defense, my March 1981 budget called for net spending
reductions totaling $331 billion over five years; but Congress
approved less than 40 percent of those reductions.
   Wasteful programs continued to be funded.
   The necessary reductions have still not been made.
   If the deficit is not curbed by continuing to limit the appetite
of government, we put in jeopardy all that we worked so hard over
the years to achieve.
   Large deficits brought on by excessive domestic spending undercut
the incentives to work and save by absorbing the savings that would
otherwise lead to productive investment.
   We cannot allow this to happen.

   Maintaining peace and protecting our country are the foremost

   Defense budget authority declined in real (inflation-adjusted)

1989.
   This trend cannot continue without severe impact on combat
readiness.
   Therefore, my budget requests defense funding of $315 billion in
budget authority and $303 billion in outlays for 1990, and $331
billion in budget authority and $314 billion in outlays in 1991.
   These amounts provide 2 percent annual real growth in budget
authority over the 1989 level, bringing it back up to the 1984 level
in inflation-adjusted terms by 1991.
   The budget also projects 2 percent real growth in these programs
in future years.
   We must continue to maintain our nuclear deterrent.
   For 1990, the budget proposes $9 billion for atomic energy
defense programs, a $0.9 billion increase over 1989.

nuclear materials production complex and to increase environmental

<HEAD>Court Bars Local Governments From Receiving Some Revenue Sharing
Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today barred local
governments from receiving $180 million in federal revenue sharing
funds withheld by the Reagan administration.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that the money
properly was withheld under budget cuts imposed by the so-called
Gramm-Rudman Act.
   Congress appropriated more than $4 billion for revenue sharing
for the 1986 fiscal year.
   After Gramm-Rudman was enacted _ a law aimed at eliminating the
federal budget deficit by 1991 _ President Reagan ordered $180
million in revenue sharing funds withheld in 1986.
   Later that year, Congress passed and Reagan signed a law
repealing the revenue sharing program.
   Representatives of local governments in early 1987 asked the
Reagan administration to pay the $180 million that had been held
back the previous year. The administration refused the request.
   The local governments then went to federal court and a judge
ordered the government to pay the $180 million.
   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last March that
the administration acted properly.
   The appeals court said the intent of Gramm-Rudman was not merely
to freeze budget cuts temporarily.
   ``Merely freezing the fiscal year 1986 entitlements and
resuscitating them in fiscal year 1987... would not result in any
meaningful deficit reduction and could be characterized by critics
to be a sham,'' the appeals court said.
   Barring the local governments from receiving the money ``may be
harsh,'' the appeals court added. ``But we believe it is consistent
with congressional intent.''
   The case is National Association of Counties vs. Brady, 88-505.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether Congress may outlaw all sexually explicit telephone dial-up
message services, known as ``dial-a-porn.''
   The justices will rule, sometime by July, on the validity of a
1988 law that sought to ban all obscene and indecent messages
available through dial-a-porn services.
   A federal judge in California ruled that the law could be applied
to ban all obscene messages, but he struck down the law's ban on
messages deemed merely indecent.
   U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima in Los Angeles based his
July 19 ruling on past Supreme Court decisions that excluded obscene
material _ but not all sexually explicit or indecent material _ from
constitutional free-speech protections.
   The Reagan administration appealed directly to the Supreme Court,
challenging the part of the July ruling that protects indecent
material.
   Sable Communications of California Inc., a major purveyor of
dial-a-porn services in that state, filed a counter-appeal
challenging the part of Tashima's ruling that allows the ban on
materials judged to be obscene.
   Today, the justices granted review to both appeals.
   Twice in 1988 the justices had refused to review dial-a-porn
controversies, in cases from Arizona and New York.
   Obscenity is a legal term that does not apply to all sexually
explicit material.
   The Supreme Court since 1973 has defined obscenity as a work that
appeals to a morbid interest in sex with patently offensive
depictions or descriptions of sexual conduct, and one that taken as
a whole has no serious literary, artistic, political or scientific
value.
   Sexually explicit material, often called pornography, may or may
not be legally obscene.
   In 1978, the high court drew a distinction between obscene and
``indecent'' expression when it allowed federal regulators to
restrict the broadcast of indecent language.
   Upholding the government's power to punish use of ``dirty words''
over the airwaves at times when children might be listening, the
court seemed to adopt the Federal Communications Commission's
definition of indecent _ ``patently offensive references to
excretory and sexual organs or activities.''
   Congress in 1983 imposed restrictions on the dial-a-porn business
but did not seek a total ban until enacting the 1988 law.
   ``Congress concluded that there was no sufficiently effective
measure to eliminate access of children to dial-a-porn short of an
outright ban,'' Justice Department lawyers told the court.
   They said the court's 1978 decision restricting the broadcasting
of indecent language ``suggests that (the 1988 law) is consistent
with the First Amendment,'' the constitutional protection of freedom
of speech.
   The government's appeal acknowledged, however, that the FCC's
general counsel has said the commission believes the 1978 Supreme
Court ruling does not authorize a total ban on merely indecent
language.
   Lawyers for Sable Communications argued that the entire 1988 law
should be struck down.
   Dial-a-porn companies make their services available to callers
through 976-exchange numbers and AT&amp;T's area code 900 long-distance
lines.
   The telephone company typically charges callers according to
per-call rates, retaining a portion of the charges and giving the
remainder to the dial-a-porn company.
   The 976 and 900 exchanges also are used for other,
non-controversial types of messages such as sports scores, time
checks and stock market reports.
   The cases are FCC vs. Sable Communications, 88-525, and Sable
Communications vs. FCC, 88-515.

<HEAD>Court to Decide if Justice Must Supply Magazine with Tax Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether the Justice Department must supply a weekly tax magazine
with copies of all federal trial court opinions and orders in tax
cases.
   The justices said they will review a ruling that the Freedom of
Information Act imposes such an obligation on the Justice
Department's tax division.
   Government lawyers, warning of ``enormous administrative costs
and burdens'' at taxpayer expense, contend that the 1966 law imposes
no such obligation.
   Tax Analysts, a Washington-based weekly magazine reporting
legislative, judicial and regulatory developments in federal
taxation, first invoked the FOIA in 1984 in seeking timely copies of
federal court opinions and orders from the Justice Department.
   Such opinions and orders are available to the public from the
individual courts but the magazine had difficulty in obtaining them
quickly.
   The Justice Department's tax division turned down the magazine's
FOIA requests, and a federal trial judge upheld the denial.
   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last April 29
that the government must comply with the magazine's FOIA requests.
   ``Imposing an enormous and costly administrative burden on the
Justice Department to secure already publicly available material for
a commercial publication is certainly not the commonly perceived
purpose of the FOIA,'' the appeals court said. ``Nonethleless, we
cannot find in the words of the statute any exemption to cover such
a situation.''
   The appeals court added that ``the burden in this case may not be
so excessive as the department makes out.''
   Government lawyers estimate that complying with the Tax Analysts
requests on a regular basis would cost nearly $75,000 a year for
search time alone.
   They say commercial publishers and law firms would flood the
Justice Department with similar FOIA requests if the appeals court
ruling is not overturned.
   The appeals court ruled that federal trial court opinions and
orders sent to the Justice Department are ``agency records'' under
the FOIA, and that they are being ``improperly withheld'' from the
tax magazine.
   In the appeal acted on today, government lawyers said the appeals
court was wrong on both points.
   The case is Justice Department vs. Tax Analysts, 88-782.

one-third of the project's costs.
   The SSC as currently envisaged will be the largest pure science
project ever undertaken.
   It will help keep this country on the cutting edge of high energy
physics research well into the next century.

<HEAD>Seven Skiers Survive Storm, Avalanche on Mount Rainier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATIA BLACKBURN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven skiers spent a night in a makeshift snow
shelter and then survived an avalanche after getting lost during a
sudden storm on Mount Rainier.
   ``It was an extremely calm and well-organized group, which really
made a big difference,'' Lonnie Rosenwald, 33, of Seattle. Their
ordeal ended safely Sunday when the group members met up with a
rescue team on their way down the mountain.
   Still, she said, ``There were lots of times we thought our lives
were in danger. There were times we didn't think we were going to
get out of there.''
   The skiers, all experienced at wilderness survival, left Saturday
on what was supposed to be a one-day back-country ski trip to the
Muir snowfield on the south flank of the 14,410-foot mountain. While
they were attempting to return that afternoon, a storm closed in and
they got lost in a steep valley, Rosenwald said.
   The skiers, on a trip sponsored by the Seattle Mountaineers Club,
tried until midnight to climb out of the valley and then decided to
build a structure and a small fire to survive the night.
   ``It was a wonderful structure,'' said Rosenwald. ``It was a
six-foot by three-foot hole in the snow, with a roof consisting of
skis, poles, and pine boughs covered by snow. It was rectangular. It
snowed all night and we stayed dry.''
   The group members, ranging in age from 31 to 68, was experienced
and fit and had proper clothing, Rosenwald said. No one panicked,
and no one got dangerously cold.
   On Sunday morning, as the skiers set out to return, five of them
were caught in an avalanche, Rosenwald said. Everyone was able to
``swim'' through the 200-foot slide safely except for one man, who
hit a tree and was slightly injured.
   They then opted to ski down the creek valley, correctly guessing
that it would take them to a road that leads to a National Park
Service facility at Paradise.
   Just before dusk, the group met a Rescue team that had been
searching for them in heavy snow and winds since daybreak Sunday.
   ``It was nice to see the rescuers, but we would have made it,''
Rosenwald said. ``There were 12 of them. They had food and water and
dry clothing. ... The park service brought us to Paradise, and let
us warm up.''
   Park ranger Bill Dengler said the skiers were in ``good condition
and delighted to get back inside and get into a warm area, out of
the cold.''

<HEAD>Mother Who Refused to Disclose Whereabouts of Daughter Loses Appeal</HEAD>

   A mother jailed since August 1987 for refusing
to disclose the whereabouts of her daughter, whom she says was
sexually abused by the child's father, lost a Supreme Court appeal
today.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a contempt citation
against Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, a District of Columbia plastic surgeon.
   Morgan, 41, was imprisoned in August 1981 for defying an order by
District of Columbia Judge Herbert B. Dixon Jr. that she allow her
daughter, Hilary, then 5, to spend a two-week unsupervised visit
with Dr. Eric A. Foretich.
   Foretich is Hilary's father and Morgan's former husband.
   Morgan sent the child into hiding to protect her, she said, from
sexual abuse by Foretich, who has denied abusing his daughter.
   The judge last Dec. 15 refused to free Morgan after more than 15
months in jail, saying he is not convinced her imprisonment will
fail to coerce her into disclosing Hilary's whereabouts.
   ``The coercion has only just begun,'' Dixon said. He added, ``It
could be a month, it could be a year, it could be more than that''
before he is convinced ``there is no realistic possibility of her
relenting.''
   Morgan has been held in civil contempt, imposed to coerce someone
into complying with a court order. The citation requires
imprisonment for an indefinite period. Criminal contempt, by
contrast, is imposed for a limited sentence as punishment.
   In her Supreme Court appeal, Morgan said her rights were violated
because Dixon conducted much of the hearing that led to the contempt
citation in private.
   The judge said he was trying to protect Hilary from public
disclosure of the details of her father's alleged sexual abuse. Many
of the specific charges were made public in a separate federal court
suit against Foretich by Morgan.
   Dixon ruled in 1986 that Morgan failed to prove Foretich had
abused Hilary. He said there was equal evidence on both sides of the
case. The judge permitted brief supervised visits for the father,
and in August 1987 granted Foretich a two-week unsupervised visit
that led Morgan to send her daughter into hiding.
   Morgan said Dixon was biased against her, and wrongly refused to
believe evidence indicating Hilary had been abused.
   An appeals court here ruled last August that Morgan's rights were
not violated.
   ``A review of the record shows that there was proabable evidence
on both sides of the issue of abuse,'' the appeals court said. It
added that it is unable to conclude that Dixon was ``clearly
erroneous'' in granting Foretich a two-week visit.
   The appeals court noted that a court-appointed guardian for
Hilary opposed the visit but had not argued that Dixon abused his
discretion in ordering the visit.
   The appeals court also upheld Dixon's decision to bar the public
from hearing Morgan's testimony about specific alleged acts of
sexual abuse.
   Morgan said the public has been prevented from hearing crucial
evidence that is vital to an issue of national debate.
   Her lawyers said studies show that sex abuse charges are made in
some 2 percent of contested custody and visitation cases.
   Calling the figure one of ``alarming frequency,'' they said
doubts have been raised about the ability of judges to referee such
disputes.
   Growing numbers of ``desperate parents have ... taken their
children and disappeared'' because the parents ``have lost faith in
the willingness and ability of the judicial system to protect their
children,'' Morgan's appeal said.
   The case is Morgan vs. Foretich, 88-737.

   The world's first recipient of a heart-liver
transplant is back in Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh for tests on
her liver.
   Stormie Jones, 11, was admitted around midnight Sunday, said
hospital spokeswoman Lynn McMahon. Her mother, Lois Purcell,
accompanied her from their home in White Settlement, Texas.
   Stormie looks well and is in good condition, but recent blood
tests found elevated levels of body toxins that the liver should be
removing, said Miss McMahon.
   Doctors Thomas Starzl and Henry Bahnson performed Stormie's
pioneering transplant operation at Children's Hospital in February
1984 when she was endangered by hyper-cholesterolemia, a disorder in
which great amounts of fat accumulate in the blood.
   She returned last October for reconstruction of a bile duct.
   Miss McMahon said it was not clear whether her new symptoms are
related to the bile duct problem.

<HEAD>Justices to Consider New Orleans Electric Service Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether federal courts should referee some disputes over electric
power rates between public utilities and local or state regulatory
agencies.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by New Orleans Public
Service Inc., a utility company seeking to pass on to its customers
$135 million in costs.
   The high court, in a related ruling last June, severely limited
the authority of states to lower electric rates that public
utilities charge as a result of agreements with federal regulators.
   But that decision left unanswered whether federal judges should
rule in such disputes or leave these matters to state courts.
   The case acted on today stems from a nearly decade-old dispute
between New Orleans Public Service, or NOPSI, and the city council,
which under Louisiana law sets utility rates charged consumers in
New Orleans.
   The council barred NOPSI from charging customers for the costs
the utility incurred in buying electric power generated by the $3.6
billion Grand Gulf 1 nuclear power plant in Port Gibson, Miss.
   The rates charged NOPSI to purchase power from Grand Gulf were
set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
   Therefore, NOPSI argued, city and state officials are powerless
to prevent it from passing on the costs to its customers.
   The federal commission in 1985 ordered NOPSI to pay 17 percent of
the cost of constructing Grand Gulf 1.
   NOPSI, in a partial settlement with the city council in 1986,
agreed to absorb $51.2 million of the costs of Grand Gulf.
   NOPSI said the city gave assurances it would be allowed to
recover the remaining $135 million share of its costs through higher
retail rates over a period of time.
   But the council said the utility acted imprudently in failing to
resell the power it agreed to purchase from Grand Gulf and blocked a
pass-through.
   NOPSI sued in federal court for permission to pass on the $135
million to its customers, arguing that the federal commission's role
in the matter preempted the city council's power.
   A federal judge denied NOPSI's claim, and the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals upheld the ruling last July.
   The appeals court said, ``A federal court with jurisdiction over
a matter that also lies within the jurisdiction of a state court or
agency should abstain from exercising its jurisdiction. New Orleans
Public Service must seek relief elsewhere.''
   The Reagan administration urged the Supreme Court to overrule the
5th Circuit court and order the federal courts to decide the dispute.
   The Justice Department said that at the very least it should be
made clear that federal courts have power to allow utilities to pass
on such costs temporarily to customers while the case is pending in
the courts.
   ``A delay in passing those costs through in retail rates will
often have consequences that are irreparable,'' government lawyers
said. ``It may create immediate cash flow problems and uncertainties
that may threaten bankruptcy, impede securities offerings and force
compromise settlements.''
   The case is New Orleans Public Service vs. New Orleans City
Council, 88-348.

<TEXT>
   George Bush today studied President Reagan's
$1.15 trillion budget, and a transition official said the
president-elect ``agrees with its intent'' although still planned to
submit his own modifications.
   Bush transition spokeswoman Sheila Tate said that the vice
president himself might issue a brief statement on it later in the
day.
   But another transition official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that Bush was prepared to say that Reagan's spending
outline ``says for one thing that you can meet the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings targets without raising taxes.''
   It was a reference to the federal spending law that limits the
deficit in the fiscal 1990 year _ the one the new budget covers _ to
no more than $100 billion. The Reagan document envisions a $92.5
billion deficit.
   ``It's a good budget that does that,'' the Bush transition
official continued. ``Naturally, he agrees with its intent. And,
naturally, he'll have his own recommendations, or put forth
potential amendments, once he takes office.''
   ``But he won't be presenting any of those recommendations until
he's prepared to present all of them to the Congress, whatever time
that might be,'' the official said.
   The Reagan budget was designed, in part, to smooth the way for
the upcoming Bush budget plan, Reagan administration and Bush
transition officials said.
   Outgoing Budget Director Joseph R. Wright Jr. said Sunday the
final Reagan budget was designed with a ``dual purpose'' in mind,
summing up Reagan's philosophy while providing Bush ``with a good
base to begin negotiations with Congress.''
   Bush himself has said he won't submit a completely new plan of
his own, but will outline what he'll ``add here and take off
there,'' much of it to be spelled out in an address to a joint
session of Congress in early February.
   Congressional Democratic leaders have indicated they would like
to get Bush's final budget plan by no later than Feb. 20 so Congress
can begin work on its own budget and meet the goal of finishing work
on spending bills before the August recess.
   And leaders are indicating they are giving Bush the benefit of
the doubt on his much-touted concept of a ``flexible freeze'' to
hold overall spending increases generally to the rate of inflation _
but without a tax increase.
   ``My own view is that is very difficult,'' Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Sunday on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.''
   But, he continued: ``(Bush) has said it can be done and that he
will do it. ... My feeling is let's give him a chance to see if he
meant what he said and if he can do what he promised.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, appearing on the
same program, said he believes Bush is committed to his campaign
pledge not to raise taxes. ``I think George Bush meant it and if
people don't read lips in this town, I think they are going to be
left out somewhere,'' Dole said.
   Reagan's final gift to Bush is a fiscal 1990 budget document that
appears to meet that mathematical goal. Reagan's plan calls for
spending increases of 4.5 percent _ comparable to the 1988 rate of
inflation of about 4.4 percent.
   Under the Bush ``flexible freeze,'' any increased spending must
be offset in general by reductions in other areas.
   And, while Bush is certain to come up with his own specifics to
bring about some of the ``kinder, gentler nation'' programs he
talked about in his campaign, Reagan's budget appears to open the
way for such changes.
   Rather than calling for wholesale elimination of agencies and
programs, as past Reagan budgets have done, the new plan was
expected to be more selective, singling out specific programs and
spending items instead.
   That will make it easier for Bush to shape his own budget outline
by offering amendments to the Reagan plan.
   And some of Bush's pet campaign themes, including more funds for
education, were already contained in the Reagan proposal.
   ``There's no question, his (Bush's) first test of leadership will
be on this issue,'' Rep. Leon E. Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the
House Budget Committee, said.
   ``The real question will not be the news in the Reagan budget,
but how the new president responds to the challenges contained in
the Reagan budget,'' Panetta said in an interview.
   Bush and his lieutenants have maintained a low profile in the
preparation of the Reagan budget. However, his choice for budget
director, Richard G. Darman, has made frequent trips to Capitol Hill
to meet with Republican budget writers.
   In the meetings, Darman indicated the forthcoming Bush proposals
would be general, and that the incoming president would put greater
emphasis on negotiations with Congress, according to participants.
   Bush has said he would send his budget negotiating team, headed
by Darman, to meet with congressional leaders at the outset of his
presidency.
   Darman was kept closely informed on details of the preparation of
the final Reagan budget. And Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady _ a
close Bush confidant whom the vice president has announced he will
retain _ also played a role in shaping it.
   Wright, the outgoing Reagan budget director, said in an interview
on Sunday that the Reagan budget ``satisfies two requirements very
well.''
   ``It is President Reagan's last budget,'' he said. ``It is a
responsible, conservative budget. But it has also been put through a
reasonable test. If President-elect Bush wants to use it that way,
it provides him with a good base to begin negotiations with Congress
during a very tough year.''

   Other areas of federal responsibility receive priority funding in
this budget:
   _To continue the Federal Aviation Administration's multiyear
program to increase its controller and inspector workforces and to
modernize the nation's aid traffic control systems, the budget
provides $7.7 billion _ a 17 percent increase over the 1989 level.
   _To alleviate the problems facing our savings institutions, I
propose that the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation
(FSLIC) spend $16 billion in 1989 and $9 billion in 1990 to address
the most serious thrift institution problems.
   The secretary of the treasury is developing a comprehensive plan
to resolve the savings industry's problems, and reform the financial
institution regulatory structure and deposit insurance system to
prevent a reoccurrence of these problems.
   I expect the secretary to submit his proposals to the new
president shortly.
   _To improve coordination of federal rural development programs
and to redirect funding toward needy rural areas and program
recipients, I am continuing support of the rural development
initiative coordinated by the secretary of agriculture.
   _By emphasizing housing vouchers, I would provide housing
assistance to 132,000 additional low-income households in 1990, 5
percent more than the 126,124 additional households receiving
housing subsidies in 1989.
   Housing vouchers can serve more low-income households at a lower
federal cost and provide greater opportunity for these families to
rent housing of their own choosing.
   _To maintain the progress we have been making in fostering state
and local education reform, I would sustain the present level of
spending on discretionary education programs at $18.5 billion, but
refocus those funds to put more money where the needs of the
disadvantaged and students with handicaps are greatest.
   _To continue the significant progress we have made in cleaning up
the environment, I recommend a $153 million increase for the
Environmental Protection Agency's regulatory, research and
enforcement programs.
   I also recommend an increase of $315 million for the Superfund
hazardous waste cleanup program in order to maintain the program's
momentum and support a stronger enforcement role.
   _Because changes in the Earth's natural systems can have
tremendous economic and social effects, global climate change is
becoming a critical concern.
   Our ability to understand and predict these changes is currently
limited, and a better understanding is essential for developing
policies.
   The budget proposes a coordinated and effective federal research
program on global change.
   This budget is accompanied by a report by the Committee on Earth
Sciences that describes this program and its strategy.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Revive Bendectin Lawsuits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive
lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages in behalf of
children with birth defects allegedly caused by the anti-nausea drug
Bendectin.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by more than 800
families who sued Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, the maker of
Bendectin, in federal court in Ohio.
   Merrell Dow had agreed in a 1984 settlement to create a $120
million fund to compensate children with birth defects alledly
caused by their mothers' use during pregnancy of Bendectin.
   Under the terms of the settlement, the company did not admit the
drug had caused the defects.
   The settlement later was rejected by a federal appeals court,
which reinstated the suits against Merrell Dow. A federal jury
decided after a 22-day trial in 1985 that Bendectin did not cause
birth defects when taken in prescribed doses.
   The case was tried in Ohio because Merrell Dow has its
headquarters in Hamilton County there.
   The families that sued said they were denied a fair trial in part
because the presiding judge barred children under 10 and all
children with visible deformities from attending the trial. The
judge said allowing the young children and deformed children to
attend could inflame the jury and prejudice the case against Merrell
Dow.
   Those children were permitted to watch the trial on
closed-circuit television elsewhere in the court building.
   Also, the trial judge limited the trial's focus to determining
whether the families could prove that Bendectin causes birth defects.
   Only if the families were successful on that issue _ and they
were not _ would they then have had the opportunity at subsequent
trials to show that Merrell Dow was legally responsible for the
defects and to establish how much money the company must pay.
   The families said splitting up the issues in this manner unfairly
prevented them from presenting evidence that Merrell Dow was
negligent, guilty of fraud, failed to warn mothers of the drug's
dangers and violated a federal law on branding of drugs.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last August that the
trial judge did not act improperly in imposing the restrictions.
   The appeals court rejected arguments that splitting up the trial
and barring young children and those with deformities from attending
created a ``sterile atmosphere'' that was unfair to the plaintiffs.
   ``Sterility is not necessarily the inevitable
consequence...merely because the jury may not hear the full evidence
of defendant's alleged wrongdoing,'' the appeals court said.
   The case is Hoffman vs. Merrell Dow, 88-704.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Missouri Decision on Grand Jury Members</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today turned away arguments
that judges violate free-speech rights when keeping secret the names
of people selected as grand jury members.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a Missouri judge's
decision to bar public inspection of the names of grand jurors in a
double-murder investigation.
   St. Charles County Judge Lester W. Duggan convened a grand jury
last June to investigate James H. Williams Sr. and his wife, JoAnn
Williams.
   The couple was accused in the murder of Walter Scott, Mrs.
Williams' first husband.
   Williams also was accused of killing his ex-wife, Sharon Williams.
   After a reporter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch asked for the
names of the grand jury members, Duggan ordered the names be kept
confidential ``in the interest of the safety and welfare'' of each
grand juror.
   The Pulitzer Publishing Co., which owns the newspaper, sought to
force Duggan to release the names but a state appeals court voted,
2-1, to uphold his orders.
   The Missouri Supreme Court turned down the newspaper's appeal
last Sept. 13.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the Post-Dispatch
argued that ``access to the names of those serving on the grand jury
should be presumed open.''
   They said any judge should be required to explain the special
circumstances existing before the presumption of openness could be
overriden.
   A practice of keeping the names of grand jury members secret
``may lead to the erosion of public confidence in both state and
federal grand juries,'' the appeal said.
   Past Supreme Court rulings, relying on the ``historical
openness'' of court proceedings and the free-speech guarantees of
the Constitution's First Amendment, have recognized the public's
right to attend criminal trials, including jury selection and
pretrial hearings.
   The newspaper's appeal said those decisions should be extended to
include access to grand jurors' names.
   But St. Charles County prosecutors urged the justices to reject
the Post-Dispatch's appeal.
   They drew a distinction between open trials and traditionally
closed grand jury proceedings, saying the latter ``are not subject
to the same rigid procedural safeguards.''
   The previously most recent grand jury in St. Charles County had
been convened in 1978, and names of grand jurors were made public
then.
   But county prosecutors said the 1978 grand jury was investigating
the purchase and renovation of a building, not ``a highly
publicized, gruesome double homicide.''
   ``Public policy dictates that jurors investigating a double
homicide would reasonably require a greater level of protection ...
from possible reprisals or pressure,'' the prosecutors said.
   The case is Pulitzer Publishing Co. vs. Duggan, 88-770.

   The owner of the town's only theater
vowed not to show the film ``Mississippi Burning,'' a fictionalized
account of the killings of three civil rights workers here 25 years
ago.
   ``We're not going to show it. No way. It's not worth it,'' Lula
Ellis, who owns the Ellis theater, said Sunday. ``I just see no
reason why we should play it.''
   Ellis had said that church groups were threatening to boycott the
theater if it showed the movie, directed by Alan Parker and starring
Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe.
   On June 21, 1964, civil rights workers James Earl Chaney, 21, who
was black, and whites Andrew Goodman, 20, and Michael Schwerner, 24,
disappeared after they were released from jail in Philadelphia. They
had been stopped on speeding charges after they had been
investigating the burning of a church by the Ku Klux Klan.
   The three were found 44 days later, shot to death and buried in a
soggy earthen dam in Neshoba County.
   Ellis, who earlier this week said she hadn't made up her mind
about showing the film, said Sunday she reached a decision against
the movie after after discussing it with her son Shelly Steiger, the
theater manager.
   The movie has refocused national attention on this town of 6,800
people, which is 70 miles northwest of Jackson. The film has been
released in five cities and is scheduled for nationwide release
Friday.
   During most movies at Ellis' cinema, blacks customarily sit in
the balcony, with whites, a few blacks and Choctaw Indians sit down
in the orchestra seats. Steiger said this was by custom and was not
required by the theater management.
   Other theaters in Mississippi will run the movie.
   Monte Royal, owner of two cinemas in Meridian, which is about 40
miles southeast of Philadelphia, said he will feature the film by
Feb. 10.
   ``Even though the picture is fiction based on a factual incident,
it is indeed pertinent and part of our past,'' Royal said.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Grant Pittsburgh Professor Access to Grand Jury

   The Supreme Court today refused to grant a
college professor access to sealed grand jury records in the case of
Owen J. Lattimore, a China scholar accused in the 1950s of being a
communist sympathizer.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Prof. Robert P.
Newman of the University of Pittsburgh, who is writing a Lattimore
biography.
   Lattimore, 88, and now retired in Pawtucket, R.I., was accused by
the late Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, R-Wis., of helping to ``lose
China'' to the communists.
   A professor at Johns Hopkins University in the 1950s and an
expert in Asian affairs, Lattimore was indicted on perjury charges
by a federal grand jury after the Justice Department accused him of
lying to a congressional committee.
   Before that committee, he had denied ever being a communist agent
or sympathizer.
   Parts of the government's case were declared unconstitutional in
1952, and again in 1955 a judge threw out another indictment. The
government then dropped Lattimore's prosecution.
   Public Citizen, an organization representing Newman, said the
grand jury records could provide valuable insights into the McCarthy
era.
   ``The Lattimore indictments call into question the extent to
which unchecked prosecutorial power and congressional influence may
have been used to engineer a political prosecution and to employ the
grand jury for improper purposes,'' lawyers for Public Citizen said.
   Newman said the public has an important interest in being
informed about what happened in the grand jury probe.
   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last April that
the rule for preserving grand jury secrecy ``makes no provision for
disclosure of transcripts to a private party for historical research
purposes.''
   Newman and Public Citizen said the ruling ``places critical
information about historically important chapters of history off
limits to historians and the public.''
   They said other courts have allowed public disclosure of grand
jury testimony when it is in the public interest even if federal
rules do not authorize specifically opening the files to help
historians.
   The Reagan administration urged the Supreme Court to reject
Newman's appeal.
   ``Even if dressed up as a significant project of historical
scholarship, requests of (this) type...could not easily be
distinguished from journalistic inquiries into subjects of public
interest or requests based simply on individual or public
curiosity,'' the Justice Department said.
   The case is Newman vs. U.S., 88-548.

<HEAD>MAJOR PROGRAMS ARE REFORMED TO ACHIEVE DEFICIT REDUCTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The program structure and incentives underlying many domestic
federal programs need to be altered to promote greater efficiency
and cost-effectiveness.
   _Current farm price support programs are far too costly.
   For the period 1986-89 an estimated $130 billion in federal
spending for farm-related assistance programs provided an average of
nearly $600,000 per farmer.
   Much of this assistance goes to farmers with high incomes _ more
than twice the U.S. family average.
   I therefore propose outlay reductions for the price and income
support programs of $2 billion in 1990 and additional annual
reductions of between $2 and $2.5 billion in each year from 1991
through 1994.
   In addition, I urge reform of the counterproductive sugar price
support program.
   _The rapidly rising costs of the Medicare program need to be
moderated.
   I propose a reasonable increase in the Medicare prospective
payment system rate and reductions in hospital capital payments and
special graduate medical education payments.
   Also, in an effort to restrain excessive growth in supplementary
medical insurance (SMI) costs, I propose extension of the current
law SMI premiums, limitations on physican payments, reductions in
payments for certain overpriced procedures, and reforms in the
durable medical equipment payment system.
   Medicare spending would still grow by 9 percent between 1989 and
1990 under these proposals _ but not by the 13 percent that would
occur under current law.

<HEAD>Court Acts in Ohio Water-Rate Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to bar
city-owned water systems from charging some non-resident customers
higher rates than other non-residents even if there is no
cost-related reason.
   The court, without comment, turned down an appeal by Summit
County, Ohio, officials who said they are being charged unfair rates
by Akron, Ohio.
   The case began in 1981 when Akron officials sued Summit County
for allegedly breaking a 1979 contract between the two governmental
bodies. The city said the county illegally wittheld payment for
water supplied by the city.
   The county countersued, claiming it entered into the contract
under duress and was being charged unreasonable and discriminatory
rates by Akron.
   The county said it was being charged rates some 90 percent higher
than another Akron water customer in the area, the neighboring city
of Tallmadge.
   Summit County said it was forced to pay more because it has no
alternative source of water.
   The Ohio Supreme Court upheld the higher rates for Summit County,
ruling county officials signed a contract with the city they must
honor.
   ``The degree of control which the courts will exert over such
(city-owned) public utilities is strictly limited to protecting
residents of the municipality from the imposition of rates which are
unreasonable or which discriminate among such residents,'' the state
court said.
   The Ohio court said it presumed that the contract signed by the
county was made ``through the normal give and take of contractual
negotiation.'' The county ``entered the bargaining process freely
and without duress.''
   The state court added there is nothing wrong in charging the
county higher rates based on its need for the water, even if Akron's
cost of supplying it is no greater than in providing water for
Tallmadge.
   ``Where rates for water from a municipally owned public utility
are set forth in a contract, such rates will not be struck down as
discriminatory even where no factor exists which could justify the
rate discrimination,'' the state court said.
   The case is Summit County vs. Akron, 88-596.

<HEAD>Budget Calls For Education Programs To Be Scrapped; Spending Up Slightly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration today proposed
eliminating two dozen federal education programs while slightly
increasing overall education outlays from $20.6 billion this year to
$21.2 billion in fiscal 1990.
   Some $541 million saved by the cuts, plus another $212 million
from cost savings officials hope to achieve from the guaranteed
student loan program, would go to expand existing programs for
disadvantaged students from kindergarten to graduate school.
   The proposed budget does not incorporate any of the education
spending ideas set forth during President-elect Bush's campaign.
They included a $500 million merit schools program for schools
serving disadvantaged children and a $50 million infusion for a
magnet schools program designed to encourage parental choice.
   But Bush, who pledged during the campaign to be ``the education
president,'' is expected to rework the budget in the weeks following
his Jan. 20 inauguration. The education community asserted last week
that he needs to request an extra $2.5 billion for fiscal 1990 in
order to begin to fulfill his pledge.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said last month that ``I did
the best I could'' to secure the best possible budget for his
department.
   The document does not contain specific new initiatives reflecting
his own priorities _ cutting illiteracy and the dropout rate _ but
that could come later. Cavazos has said that after Bush takes over,
``We will be getting into some rather specific kinds of programs.''
   Among the programs on the chopping block under the Reagan plan
are the Women's Educational Equity Act research program, which
officials complain has outlived its purpose, and a two-year dropout
prevention demonstration project due to expire.
   Also suggested for extinction are programs the administration
considers duplicative, and programs officials say should be financed
by the private sector. The latter include impact aid to school
districts serving areas with tax-exempt federal installations; Star
Schools, which would put satellite technology in schools; and a
number of scholarship and fellowship programs.
   The largest dollar increase under the Reagan plan _ and one of
the only boosts higher than the anticipated 3.4 percent inflation
rate _ would go to Pell grants, the chief federal assistance program
for low-income post-secondary students.
   Current budget authority for the program is nearly $4.5 billion.
That would rise by $256 million under the Reagan plan _ a 5.7
percent hike. The maximum grant amount of $2,300 would stay the same
and the number of students receiving aid would rise 46,000 to 3.1
million.
   Reagan would increase outlays for Chapter 1, the major federal
program for low-achieving children in poor neighborhoods, from the
current $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion in fiscal 1990. Most of the
extra money would be for grants funneled to areas with the highest
concentrations of needy students.
   The Reagan budget would hike spending authority for vocational
and bilingual education programs by about 3.4 percent. Spending
authority for vocational education would rise to $949 million while
bilingual would increase to $157 million. Outlays are anticipated to
be slightly less.
   The administration is hoping to save $212 million on the
guaranteed student loan program by reducing special allowance
payments used as an incentive to lenders to participate, and by
reducing guaranteed reinsurance to lenders and state guarantor
agencies from 100 percent to 90 percent on the dollar. Congress
would have to approve both moves.
   The entitlement program currently costs the government about $3.2
billion in interest and default payments. Officials expect loan
volume to rise from $11.5 billion this year to $12.5 billion in
fiscal 1990, adding another 278,000 students to the 4 million-plus
already participating in the program.

   The Archdiocese of Detroit softened a proposal to
close or merge 48 city parishes, but Cardinal Edmund Szoka said more
than a quarter of the city's 112 parishes still would close by June
30.
   Szoka announced Sunday that 30 mostly inner-city churches would
be closed, while an additional 25 parishes would be given a year to
prove their viability. In September, a task force had recommended
that 43 churches be closed and five others merged into parishes with
more members and greater resources.
   Even with the reduced number of parishes involved, there is no
precedent in the U.S. Roman Catholic church for such large-scale
closings, Msgr. John Tracy Ellis, a historian at the Catholic
University of America in Washington, said today.
   ``The situation was entirely different in the past,'' he said.
``It was a question of how many new parishes to open, not to close.
Insofar as I can recall, there is nothing like this.''
   The church closings were necessary, officials said, because of a
white flight from the city that reduced Detroit's Catholic
population from 100,000 housholds in 1976 to fewer than 50,000 today.
   ``The church, especially the church in the city of Detroit, finds
itself in much different circumstances in 1989 than those that
existed in '69, or '59, or '29, or 1909,'' Szoka said. ``It cannot
act as though nothing has changed.''
   Szoka, who had defended the earlier church closing plan, said
Sunday the 25 churches whose survival is in doubt would be asked to
increase membership, services and parish staff.
   ``All we are ask is that they try. ... I mention to them that in
no way is there a Damocles (sword) hanging over their head,'' he
said. ``It is meant rather to be a stimulus.''
   The cardinal called for more blacks to enter religious life in
his announcement Sunday and said he also intended the closings to
help end a ``plantation mentality,'' with white parish leaders
running churches attended largely by blacks.
   One of the 30 closing churches is expected to become a black
Catholic historical museum, he said.
   The announcement in September resulted in a wave of protest
against the 1.5 million-member archdiocese, which takes in six
counties in the Detroit area. There are an estimated 50,000 to
60,000 black Catholics in the archdiocese, church officials said.
   On Sunday, at Our Lady of the Rosary, one of many churches that
appealed the closing plan, parishioners were elated at the one-year
reprieve.
   ``There's a year and a pronouncement by the archdiocese to work
with parishes to see some sort of improvement,'' said Patrick
Gossman, a member of Our Lady of the Rosary. ``We'll go on with a
certain sense of hope and work at it.''
   But there was bitterness at churches slated to close.
   At St. Philip Neri, sniffling could be heard among the 70 people
attending Mass as the Rev. Donald Walker announced that the east
side church would close.
   ``This wasn't supposed to happen,'' Walker said, referring to the
difficulty he had in making the announcement. ``I guess you just
resent it when someone comes in and tells you it's time to die.''

<TEXT>
   Best-selling author Clive Cussler and some
300 volunteers found no signs during a weekend search of a
locomotive believed buried in a dry creek bed during an 1878 flood,
but he says they have not given up hope.
   ``In order to find it, we need to know where it isn't,'' Craig
Dirgo of Cussler's National Underwater and Marine Agency said Sunday
after the search ended. ``That's the key to any search.''
   Searchers braved 20-degree weather and gusty winds to sift
through a half-mile area near here for remnants of the
Kansas-Pacific locomotive.
   The engine, 19 cars and a caboose fell 30 feet from a railroad
bridge in 1878, when a flood struck the area 30 miles east of
Denver. Twelve of the cars and the locomotive were reported to have
been buried in the sand.
   Some researchers believe that the railroad subsequently salvaged
the expensive engine, but Cussler and his band of searchers are
still hoping it's still in the ground. The group hopes to squeeze in
one more weekend of hunting before spring to search a two-mile area
downstream from the original bridge.
   ``We know it's here and we will be back,'' Dirgo said.
   Volunteer Eric Walker of Darwin, Australia, found a part from a
railroad flat car. Others found slag and coal, which officials said
may have been used for ballast by the railroad.
   Cussler said if the locomotive is found, it will belong to the
landowner. Mike Pinzenscham, who watched the dig's progress with his
8-year-old son, Justin, said his family has owned the land for about
25 years.
   Through the Arvada-based agency, Cussler, the author of ``Raise
the Titanic,'' has located 54 sunken vessels including a dirigible.
But this is his first buried train hunt.
   The agency's next project will be a search for the steamship New
Orleans, which was built by Robert Fulton in 1811. Cussler said the
ship's bottom was torn out when it ran aground on a stump in the
Mississippi River at Baton Rouge, La.

   These reforms reinstate successful incentives employed in the
early 1980s.
   My budget also proposes restructuring federal financing of
administrative expenses to give states greater incentives to operate
their administrative systems as efficiently as possible.
   _The government often continues programs at the federal level
that are either duplicative or are no longer needed, or more

   This is the case with the Economic Development Administration,
Amtrak, urban mass transit discretionary grants, and most operating
subsidies for the Postal Service.
   Efforts to reverse this situation have been undertaken by prior
administrations as well as my own.
   These programs should be eliminated.
   The budget proposes termination of 82 programs that are not
needed to satisfy national priorities.
   _Under current law, outlays for federal employee retirement and
health benefits are estimated to grow from $51.3 billion in 1989 to
$55.9 billion in 1990.
   I propose freezing retirement cost-of-living allowances (COLAs)
and other reforms to hold the 1990 level to slightly above that for

   Ghana's top diplomat today called on China to free
an African student arrested in a racial brawl, while other African
diplomats urged their students to end a class boycott begun by the
fighting.
   ``We are not satisfied. The case has not been handled properly,''
said Ghana's charge d'affaires, Kwadwo Kwakye. ``We want (him) to be
released.''
   Alex Dosoo of Ghana, a student at Hehai University in eastern
Nanking city, was arrested Dec. 31 and charged with beating and
seriously injuring a Hehai employee during the Dec. 24 clash.
   Police gave two other African students from Gambia and Benin 15
days ``disciplinary detention'' as punishment for having ``tried to
stir up trouble.''
   In a development apparently unrelated to the racial tensions, an
Ugandan medical student jumped from a sixth-floor dormitory window
at a campus in southern Canton city Friday, killing himself.
   Xinhua, the official news agency, said Nsubuga David Mugwanya,
26, had been depressed about financial problems and examination
failures.
   The clash between African students and Chinese school workers and
students began when the Africans brought Chinese women to a dance
Dec. 24.
   Kwakye said the fight ``happened on a campus and should have been
handled by the university and not handed over to the police.''
   In a telephone interview, he said he did not think Dosoo should
face criminal charges.
   He said authorities took three days to inform the embassy of
Dosoo's arrest and still have not advised them of any formal charges
or what punishment the student might face.
   ``We have protested his detention and the fact that we were not
notified,'' said Kwakye.
   He was among 11 African diplomats who met Chinese authorities and
African students in Nanking over the weekend.
   Kwakye said he told Ghanaian students today that ``it was within
their rights'' to boycott, ``but that they must be careful not to
contravene the law.''
   The official Xinhua News Agency quoted other diplomats as saying
they plan to advise their students to return to classes and obey the
law. The approximately 140 African students in Nanking have not
attended classes since the clash.
   About 500 African students at Beijing Languages Institute have
boycotted classes since Dec. 4 to protest charges by Chinese
students that an African man assaulted a Chinese woman in her
dormitory. The Africans say the story is fabricated and demand an
apology.
   Institute president Liu Bisong sent a letter today urging
boycotting students to return to class. Liu said Chinese students at
the school were wrong to protest last week, but that the class
boycott also was ``erroneous.''
   Ghana is the only African country that has said it is considering
bringing its 26 students in China home.

<TEXT>
   An American who escaped a massacre at the hands
of the Japanese in World War II was reunited today with one of his
Filipino rescuers, 44 years after being freed.
   ``It was a great feeling,'' said Glenn McDole of Des Moines,
Iowa, describing his reaction to seeing Mary Anne Ancheta, now of
Algoma, Wis.
   In a brief appearance on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' show,
Mrs. Ancheta said the reunion fulfilled a longtime dream.
   ``All along I have been hoping that I would meet one of them,''
she said.
   In 1944, the malaria-weakened McDole and several other escapees
were brought to a Filipino guerrilla camp run by Maziro Major, Mrs.
Ancheta's father. Major, now 88, is retired after an Army career and
lives in Manila.
   At the time, Mrs. Ancheta was 7 years old. She said she
remembered McDole because he was the one ``shaking like a leaf''
from the effects of the disease, but she hadn't remembered his name.
   Last month, Mrs. Ancheta, now a nurse, saw an article about a
reunion of the prisoners of war. The story quoted McDole, and she
called him on New Year's Eve.
   That first attempt at a reunion ran afoul when the tape on
McDole's answering machine ran out before she could give her last
name and telephone number. But she tried again after reading an
article about McDole's anguish over missing the call from ``Mary
Anne from Wisconsin.'' The two chatted for the first time last week.
   McDole, 67, now chief of the patrol division in the Polk County
sheriff's office, said he was one of about 150 American prisoners
being held at Palawan Prison when American troops landed nearby.
   He said the captors ordered the prisoners into long trenches,
then threw gasoline and torches on them. About 20 prisoners broke
through the side of a trench and scrambled down a cliff to safety,
but many were shot before they could run away.
   McDole said he was treated and sheltered for about a month by
Major's group.

<HEAD>Reagan Would Spend More Than $1 Billion on AIDES</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan today asked Congress to
increase spending on AIDS research by 24 percent and trim the growth
of the huge Medicare and Medicaid health programs by cutting
payments to states and fees to hospitals and physicians.
   Overall, the proposed fiscal 1990 budget for the Department of
Health and Human Services would increase 5.7 percent to $424.4
billion in fiscal 1990.
   The department is the largest Cabinet agency in terms of
spending, accounting for 37 percent of federal outlays, including an
anticipated $257 billion on Social Security for the next fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1.
   The budget proposal would add $311 million to the fight against
the spread of the deadly acquired immune deficiency syndrome, ``our
highest public health priority.'' The increase would raise spending
for research, education and prevention of the disease to $1.6
billion.
   The department estimates another $925 million will be spent on
treatment and income support to AIDS victims through Medicaid,
Medicare, Disability Insurance and other service programs.
   The overwhelming bulk of the department's spending is earmarked
for entitlements _ Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid _ over
which the agency has little budget control since eligibility for the
programs is set by Congress.
   If no changes were made, Medicare _ which pays for the health
care of about 34 million elderly and disabled Americans _ would grow
by 14 percent in fiscal 1990.
   However, Reagan proposes trimming that growth rate to 10 percent
by cutting $3.5 billion from fees paid to physicians and hospitals.
His Medicare budget would total $94.9 billion.
   About a third of the Medicare cut, $1 billion, would come from
reducing the additional disbursements that teach hospitals receive
to cover their costs of training interns and residents.
   Other reductions would be made in payments to hospitals for
capital costs and fees to physicians for certain procedures,
including radiology, anesthesiology and surgery, under the Medicare
payments system.
   A new part of Medicare is the Catastrophic Health Insurance
program, which is intended to be entirely self-supporting. It is
financed by premiums paid by Medicare recipients, which are
projected to total about $8.6 billion in fiscal 1990. But the
program is projected to spend only $4 billion that year.
   Medicaid _ the program that provides health care for about 26
million low-income Americans _ would grow about 9 percent next year
if unchanged. The administration, however, is proposing to slice the
growth to 5 percent growth or by about $1.4 billion to a spending a
total of $36 billion.
   Much of the reduction would come from reducing payments to the
states, which administer the program under federal guidelines, by
about $1.1 billion.
   Benefits under the Social Security program are protected and
recipients. Based on administration estimates of what inflation will
be this year, the budget projects Social Security recipients getting
a 3.6 percent cost-of-living increase in their benefits in January
1990.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Agrees to Review Missouri Law Regulating Abortions</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts grafs 29-41, In other action, with other cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, acting in an appeal urging
reversal of its landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion
nationwide, today agreed to review a Missouri law regulating
abortions.
   The justices said they will study a federal appeals court ruling
that struck down key provisions of the state law.
   Even before today's action in the appeal filed by Missouri
officials, the case had become the most-watched battleground in the
continuing political war over abortion. Justice Department lawyers
also are urging the high court to use the case as a means of undoing
its 1973 ruling, called Roe vs. Wade.
   But nothing in the brief order issued today suggested that the
justices will reconsider Roe vs. Wade.
   The court's eventual decision, expected by July, could resolve
the Missouri controversy without significantly changing the 1973
decision or other past rulings on abortion.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last July 13 struck down,
among other aspects of the Missouri abortion law, these five
provisions:
   _A ban on using public hospitals or other government-run
facilities for abortions not necessary to save a woman's life.
   _A ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or
assisting an abortion.
   _A ban on using taxpayer money for ``encouraging or counseling''
women to have abortions.
   _A requirement that doctors planning to abort a fetus believed to
be older than 19 weeks test for weight and lung capacity to
determine whether the fetus is capable of surviving outside the womb.
   _A declaration that ``the life of each human being begins at
conception.''
   The appeals court upheld a provision in the state law that bans
the use of taxpayer money for performing or assisting an abortion.
But it said use of a public facility or the services of a public
employee cannot be banned if all such costs are reimbursed by a
patient.
   In the apppeal acted on today, Missouri Attorney General William
L. Webster said the 8th Circuit court's ruling ``expands (Supreme
Court) precedents in favor of abortion on demand, further contracts
the state's compelling interest in the life of viable, unborn
children and disregards this court's holdings that abortion is a
private matter which government need in no way subsidize.''
   The 1973 decision ``should itself be reconsidered'' if it cannot
be squared with the disputed Missouri law, Webster said.
   William Bradford Reynolds, then chief of the Justice Department's
civil rights division, wrote to Missouri officials last summer
urging them to include a challenge of Roe vs. Wade in the state's
appeal.
   ``I felt this was the best case on the horizon to undertake
reconsideration of Roe,'' Reynolds told The Wall Street Journal in a
recent interview.
   In a brief filed two days after the presidential election ast
Nov. 8, Justice Department lawyers supported Missouri's appeal.
   That sparked Molly Yard, president of the National Organization
for Women, to accuse the Justice Department of ``declaring war on
the women of this country.''
   Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority,
said there will be ``no honeymoon on the issue of abortion'' for
President-elect Bush because of the Justice Department's involvement
in the Missouri case.
   In its 1973 ruling, the Supreme Court said women have a
constitutional right of abortion, based on the right of privacy. The
court most recently reaffirmed that ruling in 1983.
   Today's court is viewed as deeply divided on the abortion issue.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun told a law school audience last
September that the 1973 decision he authored could be overturned in
the court's 1988-89 term.
   ``The next question is, `Will Roe vs. Wade go down the drain?' I
think there's a very distinct possibility that it will _ this term.
You can count the votes,'' he said.
   While Blackmun and Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall
and John Paul Stevens have resisted attempts to reverse or greatly
modify the 1973 decision, anti-abortion forces are hoping some day
to attract five votes for such a result.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Byron R. White
dissented from the 1973 ruling and several subsequent abortion
decisions.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in past decisions has questioned the
court's reasoning in its 1973 decision.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, who has not yet voted in an abortion
decision since being named to the high court by President Reagan in
1986, is thought to favor overturning or curtailing Roe vs. Wade.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court last Feb. 18,
likewise has not voted in an abortion decision. His views on
abortion and the Roe vs. Wade decision are not known in any
significant detail.
   In other action today, the court:
   _ Agreed to decide whether Congress may outlaw all sexually
explicit telephone dial-up message services, dubbed ``dial-a-porn.''
   The justices will judge, sometime by July, the validity of a 1988
law that sought to ban all obscene and indecent messages available
through dial-a-porn services.
   _ Allowed criminal defendants to exclude potential jurors because
of their race.
   In a case involving a black man's murder by Ku Klux Klan members,
rejected arguments by Alabama prosecutors _ supported by law
enforcement officials nationwide _ that defense lawyers unlawfully
are seeking to impanel an all-white jury in the Klan case.
   _ Refused to review lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in
damages in behalf of children with birth defects allegedly caused by
the anti-nausea drug Bendectin.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by more than 800
families who sued Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, the maker of
Bendectin, in federal court in Ohio.
   _ Let stand a contempt citation against a mother jailed since
August 1987 for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of her
daughter, whom she says was sexually abused by the child's father.
   The justices, without comment, let stand the contempt citation
against Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, a District of Columbia plastic surgeon.
   _ Barred local governments from receiving $180 million in federal
revenue sharing funds withheld by the Reagan administration.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that the money
properly was withheld under budget cuts imposed by the so-called
Gramm-Rudman Act.
   _ Turned away arguments that judges violate free-speech rights
when keeping secret the names of people selected as grand jury
members.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a Missouri judge's
decision to bar public inspection of the names of grand jurors in a
double-murder investigation.
   The abortion case is Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services,
88-605.

<HEAD>President Described As Recovering Nicely From Surgery</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Top 3 grafs UPDATE with White House comment on Reagan condition;
Picks up 3rd graf pvs, ``The president''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan is ``recovering quite well''
from successful surgery to correct a curvature of his left ring
finger, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today.
   ``He was making jokes about it,'' Fitzwater told reporters at his
daily news briefing. ``The bandage will become progressively smaller
in the next few days,'' although Reagan will wear a support splint
for several months.
   Reagan returned to the White House from Walter Reed Army Medical
Center on Sunday, a day after undergoing nearly three hours of
surgery under local anesthesia.
   The president, accompanied by first lady Nancy Reagan, lifted his
left hand, with a bulky bandage on it, as he stepped out of the
emergency entrance of the hospital in Northwest Washington.
   Asked how he felt, he replied, ``Fine,'' in a vigorous, booming
voice. After raising his bandaged left hand, he waved with his right.
   The operation was to alleviate a worsening condition known as
Dupuytren's contracture, which caused the president's fingers to
curve inward in a claw-like configuration.
   Dr. John Hutton, the White House physician, said last week the
operation would not interfere with the president's performance of
his duties.
   In a statement after the operation on Saturday, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater described the surgery as ``successfully
completed.''
   Since recovery normally takes two to three weeks, the president
may still be wearing the bandage when he turns over the reins of
government to President-elect Bush at inauguration ceremonies on
Jan. 20.

<NOTE>Improved Management</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In 1981, I made a promise to the American people ``to limit
government to its proper role and make it the servant, not the
master, of the people.''
   My ``Management Improvement Program: Reform '88'' has helped make
government more efficient and more responsive.
   We reduced waste and fraud in federal programs by combining the
efforts of the inspectors general into the President's Council on
Integrity and Efficiency, resulting in over $110 billion saved or
put to better use _ and their efforts are continuing.
   I saw that the federal government did not have effective cash
management practices for dealing with what is now a $2 trillion
annual cash flow, nor did it have a governmentwide credit management
program for what is now a $1 trillion portfolio.
   This resulted in the waste of billions of dollars each year.
   We built the necessary governmentwide controls in both areas and
stopped the drain.
   Moreover, we began the establishment of the first governmentwide
financial accounting system, consolidating and making uniform over
400 previously incompatible individual agency systems.
   This was essential for any well-managed government, and is
presently being implemented.
   The federal government has a major effect on our daily lives
through the collection of taxes and fees, the direct provisions of
services, the payment of financial assistance through various
entitlement programs, and the regulation of commercial enterprises.
   Through modernization, improved administration, and automated
services the government has made substantial reductions in the time
it takes to provide services to the public.
   As the 21st century approaches, the federal government must adapt
its role in our society to changing conditions and changing
technology.
   At the turn of the century, the U.S. population will exceed 268
million, with a larger proportion of elderly citizens.
   Changes in technology and communication will increasingly link
the world's economies, trade, capital flows, and travel as never
before.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Bankruptcy Issue in Connecticut Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether states generally are immune from being sued for money
damages by bankruptcy trustees.
   The court said it will use two cases of bankrupt businesses in
Connecticut to determine whether states, and possibly the federal
government also, enjoy such immunity.
   The justices will hear an appeal by Martin W. Hoffman, a
court-appointed trustee supervising payment to creditors of
Willington Convalescent Home Inc. and Edward Zera, who ran a
maintenance service.
   The nursing home, which shut down in April 1983, said Connecticut
officials owed it $64,010 in Medicaid payments for patients treated
at the home.
   Zera, who declared bankruptcy in 1983, sought to recover $2,100
in taxes paid to Connecticut.
   Hoffman invoked federal bankruptcy law to recover the money in
behalf of the nursing home and Zera and use it to help pay their
creditors.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last June that the
immunity from money damages states generally enjoy extends to
federal bankruptcy law.
   The Reagan administration said it agrees with the 2nd Circuit
court ruling, but urged the Supreme Court to hear arguments in the
case because other federal appeals courts have taken an opposite
view.
   Such disputes arise frequently and the conflict should be
resolved by the high court, the Justice Department said.
   The department said the reasoning of the 2nd Circuit court
appears to apply to federal agencies as well as to states.
   The Supreme Court is expected to announce a decision by July.
   The case is Hoffman vs. Connecticut, 88-412.

20-year-old man gunned down as he rode with a teen-ager on a
bicycle, authorities said today.
   Danny Perez and a 16-year-old boy were taken to County-USC
Medical Center after a shooting in East Los Angeles on Friday
evening, sheriff's Deputy Chris Wahla said today.
   Perez was pronounced dead at the hospital. The 16-year-old's

   Meanwhile, Irvin Smith, 36, was killed and another unidentified
man was injured when they were hit by a hail of gunfire late
Saturday, said Lt. Frank Valdez. He said the shooting was
narcotics-related.
   In Compton on Friday, 23-year-old David Berkley was shot and
killed in what was believed to be a gang-related attack, said police
Lt. Gary Anderson.
   Compton police were also investigating possible gang links to two
separate shootings, one of them a drive-by attack at 10:30 p.m.
Sunday in which two men and a woman were injured, said Anderson.
   The men were in critical condition and the woman was in good
condition at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center, Anderson
said. They were not identified.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling in Maryland Foster Care Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling that
expands the right of allegedly abused or mistreated foster children
to sue their social workers.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that workers may
be sued for damages under a key federal civil rights law by foster
children in federally funded programs.
   The court rejected an appeal by Maryland social service employees
seeking greater legal protection.
   The Reagan administration joined in urging the court to review a
ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Justice Department
lawyers said the appeals court ruling would expose thousands of
state and local social welfare workers to personal financial
liability for injuries suffered by children in foster homes.
   The government said the appeals court ruling could have even more
far-reaching impact if it is extended to apply to other federally
funded social welfare programs.
   State and local workers who administer Aid for Dependent
Children, Medicaid and food stamp programs also could be exposed to
the risk of big-money damages, the government said.
   The Maryland case stems from a suit against 21 officials,
caseworkers and supervisors who help administer the state's
federally funded foster care program in Baltimore.
   They were sued by children who say they were victims of physical
and sexual abuse and medical neglect.
   A federal judge ordered officials to submit a plan for improving
conditions in foster homes, and for at least monthly monitoring of
the placement of children in the homes.
   The judge also required the officials to improve medical services
for foster children and to report instances of poor medical care to
the children's attorneys.
   The judge also ruled that social workers who place or keep
children in foster homes are not entitled to immunity from lawsuits
in such cases.
   The 4th Circuit court upheld the decision in February 1988.
   The appeals court rejected the social workers' claims that a
federal law providing funds for foster care created no duty on their
part to know whether a child would be exposed to mistreatment or
abuse.
   The appeals court said the social workers' right to claim
immunity from suit must be based on more than their own belief that
they acted properly. It is up to a trial court examining the facts
to decide whether the social workers permitted mistreatment, the
appeals court said.
   The National Association of Social Workers, in supporting the
appeal by the Maryland employees, said the 4th Circuit court ruling
places social workers at risk for alleged abuses that occurred
decades earlier.
   ``No professional consensus exists even now'' on how to assure
foster children will not be harmed, the association said.
``Maltreatment of children in foster homes often is difficult, and
at times impossible, to prevent by even a very highly skilled and
well-trained social worker.''
   The Supreme Court already is studying a related issue in the case
of a Wisconsin boy who suffered severe beatings by his father.
   In that case, the justices are expected to decide whether public
officials may be sued when their alleged gross negligence permits a
child to be abused by a parent.
   Social workers were accused of failing to come to the aid of the
boy even after they had evidence that he was beaten repeatedly.
   The case acted on today focuses on whether a federal civil rights
law enacted after the Civil War permits damage suits based on
alleged violations of a 1980 law, the Adoption Assistance and Child
Welfare Act.
   The 1980 law requires states to meet certain conditions before
receiving federal funds for foster care. The 4th Circuit court said
the 1980 law creates a basis for private citizens to sue if those
conditions allegedly are not met.
   The case is Massinga vs. L.J., 87-1796.

<HEAD>Pentagon Spending Increases 2 Percent Above Inflation</HEAD>

6-8, picking up: The proposed ....</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci is asking
Congress to increase defense spending by 2 percent above the rate of
inflation for the next two years in a proposed military budget
likely to change after George Bush becomes president.
   In proposing $315.2 billion in budget authority for 1990, and
$330.89 billion for 1991, Carlucci is requesting an increase in Star
Wars spending authority from $4.1 billion in 1989 to $5.9 billion in
1990 and $7 billion in 1991.
   Under the proposed defense budget for the fiscal year beginning
next Oct. 1, although $315.2 billion would be authorized, $303
billion would actually be spent. The spending authority includes
funding for long-term projects and weapons buying in future years.
The lower figure, outlays, includes only the funds to be spent
during the 12 months of the 1990 fiscal year.
   The $303 billion in 1990 outlays includes Pentagon spending and
$9.2 billion for Energy Department nuclear weapons and research
programs, and is projected at $4.7 billion above actual spending
during this fiscal year.
   Among the requests likely to be changed by Congress or Bush are
$94.6 million in spending authority in 1990 and $124.3 million the
next year for research on a new Navy Anti-Satellite (ASAT) weapon;
and elimination of a proposed single-warhead intercontinental
ballistic missile, the Midgetman.
   In other areas of national security, the Reagan administration is
asking for an increase of $5.6 billion, to a level of $8.4 billion,
in security assistance programs to other nations. The whopping 200
percent jump comes in part because loan repayments from other
nations go down next year.
   The administration is asking for $3.8 billion for grants to
foreign countries _ mostly in the Middle East _ so they can buy U.S.
weapons.
   Another $3.5 billion is being sought in non-military aid, mostly
for Central America and the Middle East. The budget message
forecasts the request of additional money for the Contra guerrillas
of Nicaragua.
   The proposed Pentagon budget also continues production of the
newly unveiled B-2 or stealth bomber, designed to elude enemy radar.
The exact annual cost of that program remains classified, although
the Air Force announced Dec. 16 that each B-2 would cost $516
million, a total of $68.1 billion for 132 planes by 1995, making it
the most expensive plane in the world.
   The B-2 program may face trouble following disclosures of
inadequacies in electronic equipment designed to enable newly
acquired B-1B bombers to penetrate enemy defenses.
   It is also far from clear whether Bush and Congress will agree to
cancel the Midgetman, which would be designed to be fired from
mobile trucks. Last year, the Air Force volunteered to drop the
Midgetman in favor of a rail-mobile version of the 10-warhead MX, or
Peacekeeper.
   The Air Force argued that 500 warheads could be deployed on 50
Peacekeepers for $10 billion vs. $44.7 billion for the Midgetman.
   But Congress restored money for research on Midgetman, arguing
that more missiles would be harder to track and destroy, and that a
single-warhead weapon made more sense under a proposed Strategic
Arms Limitation Treaty limiting the number of launchers.
   Bush was expected to submit a revised version of the budget, and
the retired Air Force general he has named as national security
adviser, Brent Scowcroft, has publicly endorsed the Midgetman over
the MX and has suggested lower levels of funding for Star Wars,
formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   The active duty strength of the armed forces would increase by
5,000 in 1990 to a level of 2,138,300, then decrease the following
year to 2,134,600.
   The force level in the Army and Marine Corps remain the same, at
772,000 for the Army and 197,000 for the Marines, that of the Air
Force would decline slightly, from 571,000 in 1989 and 1990 to
567,000 in 1991, and that of the Navy would grow from 593,000 to
598,000 to provide crews for the addition of new aircraft carriers
to the current fleet of 13 flattops.
   The Navy must postpone its plans for a 600-ship fleet, although
Adm. Stephen Loftus told reporters that goal could be achieved
sometime in the 1990s. The number of ships would drop to 574 next
year and 571 in 1991 with retirements that include two ballistic
missiles submarines and the conversion of another into a moored
training ship in 1990.
   One submarine armed with Trident class ballistic missiles is to
be added each year, with 63 Trident II missiles delivered in 1990
and 52 in 1991.
   The Navy, as expected, will acquire two SSN-688 nuclear attack
submarines in 1990 and two SSN-21 Seawolf nuclear attack submarines
in 1991.
   The budget calls for pay raises of 3.6 percent in 1990 and 3.2
percent in 1991 for uniformed military and of 2 percent and 3
percent for civilian employees of the Defense Department.
   As the number of men and women in active service declines, the
number in the National Guard and reserves is to increase by 7,600 to
1,178,300 in fiscal 1990 and to 1,181,700 the following year.

   A mild earthquake shook the Las Vegas
area, cracking some windows and rattling nerves, but authorities
received no reports of serious damage or injury.
   ``My kid came in the living room screaming that his bed was
moving,'' said Adam Churchin, who lives four miles southeast of
downtown Las Vegas. ``It scared the living daylights out of him.''
   The temblor, centered 10 miles northeast of Las Vegas, struck at
9:08 p.m. Sunday and measured between 3.2 and 3.5 on the Richter
scale, according to seismologists at the U.S. Geological Survey
offices in Menlo Park, Calif., and Boulder, Colo.
   Earlier Sunday, the Alaksa Tsunami Warning Center reported two
moderate earthquakes in an area southeast of Adak in the Aleutian
Islands. The quakes registered 5.6 and 4.8 on the Richter scale, but
neither was felt at Adak, the nearest populated area.
   The Las Vegas quake was felt most strongly in suburban North Las
Vegas, where a Police Department switchboard operator reported
receiving at least 500 telephone calls from worried citizens.
   Some callers, including Municipal Court Judge Gary Davis,
reported cracked windows, but there were no reports of serious
property damage or injuries, according to the operator, who declined
to identify herself.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude, or the height of quake-generated shock waves recorded
on a seismograph.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area.

   Extradition proceedings for a man
accused of killing two McDonald's restaurant employees and then
arrested in Delaware will begin this week, police said.
   Robert P. Hughes IV, 21, of the suburban Philadelphia community
of Glen Mills, is charged with the two shooting deaths Sunday

   Restaurant manager Jean Reider, 41, of Newark, Del., and Charles
Hegarty, 46, of West Chester, were killed in the holdup, which
occurred before the restaurant had opened, police said.
   Hughes was arrested at the bus terminal in Wilmington, Del.,
several hours later, according to Wilmington police Sgt. Richard
Andress. He was charged with resisting arrest, carrying a concealed
deadly weapon and held as a fugitive, Andress said.
   In Pennsylvania, Hughes was charged with two counts of murder,
two counts of criminal homicide, robbery and weapons violations,
said James P. MacElree II, Chester County district attorney.

<HEAD>1990 Budget Highlights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, are the highlights of
President Reagan's proposed federal budget for the 1990 fiscal year,
beginning next Oct. 1.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>SUMMARY</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Reagan's farewell budget proposes collecting $1.059 trillion in
revenues and spending $1.152 trillion.
   That leaves a deficit of $92.5 billion, the lowest since a $73.7
billion imbalance between spending and revenues in 1981.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FEES AND TAXES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   While proposing no new taxes, the budget seeks $1 billion in a
variety of user fees, ranging from a new $25 decal for boat owners
to higher charges for getting government-backed loans, including VA
mortgages.
   The president called for a $1.7 billion tax cut for corporations
with foreign operations and recommended changes that would save the
oil and gas industries about $39 million.
   Reagan urged repeal of a law requiring that taxes on airplane
tickets, shippers and fuel be cut in half next Jan. 1, a move which
would cost shippers and travelers $1.2 billion.
   He would also require all state and local government workers to
pay the tax that funds Medicare. Those hired before April 1, 1986,
are not paying, even though most are eligible for Medicare because
of earlier, non-government employment or through their spouses. This
would raise $2 billion.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>HEALTH AND SOCIAL</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The budget proposes trimming Medicare, which provides health care
to Social Security recipients, by $3.2 billion below the projected
increase for 1990, primarily by reducing the fees received by
doctors and hospitals.
   Medicaid, which pays the health bills of poor people, would be
cut by $1.7 billion over its projected increase for 1990 with the
savings coming from reductions in federal payments to the states,
which run the Medicaid program.
   An increase of 24 percent to $1.6 billion is proposed in the
search for a cure for AIDS.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>DEFENSE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   There would be $303 billion in defense outlays, including
Pentagon spending and $9.2 billion for Energy Department nuclear
weapons and research programs. That is $4.7 billion above spending
during this fiscal year.
   Among the requests are funding for research on a new Navy
Anti-Satellite weapon; and elimination of a proposed single-warhead
intercontinental ballistic missile, the Midgetman.
   The Pentagon budget continues production of the new B-2 or
stealth bomber and seeks an increase in spending on development of
the space-based Star Wars nuclear defense shield.
   The president also proposes making a downpayment of $900 million
to start cleaning up and modernizing the government's aging nuclear
weapons facilities.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PROGRAM TERMINATIONS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The proposal calls for termination of 82 individual programs
including the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Legal Services
Corporation, the Economic Development Administration, the
Appalachian Regional Commission, direct loans by the Small Business
Administration, Amtrak railroad passenger subsidies, mass transit
grants and subsidies to airlines serving small airports.
   Reagan proposed the sale of about $6 billion in government
assets, including the two naval petroleum reserves and various
government loans held by the public.
   Reagan has tried and failed over the years to get Congress to go
along with these proposals.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>AGRICULTURE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Spending on farm programs would be cut by $9.7 billion, a 19
percent reduction, achieved in part with cuts in subsidy payments to
farmers.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FEDERAL PAY</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The budget includes $380 million to pay for the controversial 50
percent pay hike for members of Congress, federal judges and other
top federal officials. But Reagan proposed pay increases of only 2
percent for civilian employees and 3.6 percent for the military.
   He recommended skipping the annual cost-of-living increase for
federal civilian and military retirees in January 1990, to save $1.4
billion, and he proposed holding increases after that time to 1
percentage point below the inflation rate.

   The 1990 Management Report, which is being forwarded to the
Congress as part of the 1990 budget submission, reflects the
highlights of OMB's report to me on ``Government of the Future.''
   That Management Report has been expanded as a beginning to a
planning process that has, in part, shaped the proposals in this
budget and should become a part of the annual budget process.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUDGET PROCESS REFORM IS DESPERATELY NEEDED TO CONTINUE DEFICIT REDUCTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The persistence of the budget deficit is overwhelming evidence
that the federal budget process is fundamentally flawed.
   Past efforts at ``reform'' have been directed largely toward
protecting a large portion of domestic spending from real fiscal
discipline.
   Fourteen years after passage of the Congressional Budget Act and
three years after enactment of the Balanced Budget and Emergency
Deficit Control Act, the federal budget process remains unwieldy and
undisciplined.
   The American people expect better of their political system, and
they deserve it.
   Under the Congressional Budget Act, congressional budget
resolutions _ Congress' proposed budgets _ are passed each year.
   They are not sent to the president for approval and, therefore,
are not law.
   They provide guidance to the committees of Congress, but the
guidance is often late and ambiguous.
   The resolutions are usually passed well after the dates required
by law, and well after they are needed by the finance, authorizing,
and appropriations committees.
   Moreover, there is little agreement within Congress on the
guidance provided.
   The House of Representatives and the Senate do not agree, except
in the most general terms, on the priorities implied by resolutions
both have approved.
   Except for last year's on-time performance, Congress'
self-imposed budget deadlines have usually been missed, and massive
continuing resolutions and reconciliation bills have been the rule
rather than the exception.
   These large, cumbersome bills provide cozy hiding places for
hundreds of special interest add-ons, which line-item veto authority
would permit the president to challenge.
   A number of changes in the budget process _ most of which I have
recommended before _ are needed to instill budget discipline
throughout the legislative process.
   I urge Congress to adopt the following measures:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Balanced budget amendment</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ I remain committed to and urge approval of a constitutional
amendment requiring a balanced budget.
   The amendment should require a supermajority vote (at least 60
percent) in the Congress to increases taxes.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Line-item veto</HEAD>
<TEXT>
    _ My successors should be given the authority, subject to
congressional override, to veto line-items in annual appropriations
bills, in authorizing legislation that provides or mandates funding
for programs, and in revenue bills.
   Such authority would permit the elimination of substantial waste
and would be an effective instrument for enforcing budget
discipline.

<HEAD>Enhanced rescission authority</HEAD>
<TEXT>
    _To enhance the president's ability to control government
spending, I recommend that line-item veto authority be complemented
by a change in law that would require the Congress to vote ``yea''
or ``nay'' on any rescission proposed by the president.
   Current law allows the Congress to duck responsibility by simply
ignoring proposed rescissions for 45 days.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Biennial budgeting</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ The annual budget process consumes too much time and energy.
   A biennial budget would reduce the repetitive budget tasks, allow
more time for considering key spending and revenue decisions,
provide less scope for gimmicks that give the illusion of
``savings,'' such as shifting spending from one year to another
without affecting the underlying programs, and permit the
realization of real savings that would be possible with a more
assured availability of funds.
   For these reasons, I recommend that biennial budgeting be
adopted.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Joint budget resolution</HEAD>
<TEXT>
    _To ensure the broader scrutiny and stricter discipline that is
needed in the congressional budget process, I propose that Congress
be required to prepare a budget resolution covering a minimum of two
years showing revenue proposals individually and showing spending
priorities.
   The Congress should also be required to submit its budget
resolution to the president for his signature or veto.
   Subsequent legislation which exceeds these allocations should not
be considered without supermajority approval.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Individual transmittal of appropriations bills</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ The practice of transmitting full-year continuing resolutions
covering a number of appropriations bills does not permit the
legislative and executive branches to exercise proper scrutiny of
those bills.
   Too often in the past, such continuing resolutions have provided
convenient cover for special-interest spending that would not
survive close scrutiny.
   To minimize this risk, I propose that appropriations bills be
transmitted individually to the president.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Credit reform</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _ The effects of credit activities are recorded imperfectly under
current budget accounting.
   The subsidy component of federal lending programs remains hidden.
   To correct this major fault in the budget system, I recommended
credit reform legislation two years ago.
   This legislation, which I am recommending again, would measure
the true cost _ the present value _ of the subsidies provided by
federal credit programs and put that cost on an expenditure basis
equivalent to the cost of other federal programs.
   This change must be an integral part of the reform of the budget
process.

<HEAD>Court to Rule on Double Jeopardy in Missouri Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to use the case
of a convicted murderer from Missouri to study double-jeopardy
protection for criminal defendants.
   The court agreed to hear arguments by state officials seeking to
reinstate a life prison sentence for Larry P. Thomas.
   Thomas was convicted of murder and attempted robbery in an
attempted holdup of an auto parts store in St. Louis on Nov. 8, 1972.
   Mentoe Vernell, a customer at the store, died in a shootout with
Thomas.
   Thomas was sentenced to 15 years in prison for attempted robbery
and a life term for murder.
   Then-Gov. Christopher Bond of Missouri commuted the robbery
sentence in 1981 after Thomas had served about eight years. He
remained in prison on the murder conviction.
   A state court subsequently threw out the sentence for attempted
robbery and credited the time Thomas had served for that crime to
the murder sentence. The state courts said he must continue serving
the life sentence.
   Thomas then appealed in federal court to have the murder sentence
thrown out.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 5-4 ruling last
April, ruled that Thomas' right against double jeopardy was violated
because he was given multiple sentences for the same crime. The
governor's commutation means that Thomas legally had served one of
his sentences and must be set free, the appeals court said.
   ``We hold that Thomas had legally satisfied the 15-year sentence
for the attempted robbery and that his continued confinement for the
felony murder offense violated his double jeopardy rights,'' the
appeals court said.
   State officials, in appealing to the Supreme Court, said the
appeals court exceeded its authority and misinterpreted Missouri law.
   The state attorney general's office said the state courts
``cured'' the double jeopardy violation when it threw out the
sentence for attempted robbery and gave Thomas credit for time
served.
   The case is Jones vs. Thomas, 88-420.

<HEAD>Court to Study New York Challenge to Magistrates' Authority</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether federal magistrates are constitutionally authorized to
preside over jury selection when delegated such duty by federal
trial judges.
   The court said it will study the case of two men convicted in
federal court in New York City of possessing cocaine with intent to
distribute it.
   Jose Gomez and Diego Chavez-Tesina say their convictions were
tainted because the judge who presided over their trial assigned the
task of jury selection to a federal magistrate.
   Their appeals argue that such a delegation of authority violates
that part of the Constitution bestowing judicial power.
   Gomez was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 10 years parole.
Chavez-Tesina was sentenced to 20 years in prison and a lifetime
parole.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the two men's
convictions last June 1.
   The appeals court said the Federal Magistrates Act authorizes
such delegation of power for the jury-selection portions of trials,
and that the federal law does not violate the Constitution.
   Gomez and Chavez-Tesina had argued that magistrates only could be
assigned pretrial duties.
   Justice Department lawyers urged the high court to use the case
to resolve conflicting rulings on magistrates' authority between the
2nd Circuit court and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based
in New Orleans.
   According to court documents, Gomez is now an inmate at a federal
prison in Ashland, Ky., and Chavez-Tesina is imprisoned in Milan,
Mich.
   The cases are Gomez vs. U.S., 88-5014, and Chavez-Tesina vs.
U.S., 88-5158.

<HEAD>Judge Issues Restraining Order On INS Policy</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 13 grafs to UPDATE with judge issuing restraining
order against INS policy, another hearing set for Thursday. Picks up 10th
graf, `In essence...'.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge this morning issued a
temporary restraining order blocking a 3-week-old immigration
service rule that opponents say has left hundreds of Central
Americans living in tents and shanties in the lower Rio Grande
Valley.
   ``One would be blind not to recognize that we have a problem,''
said U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela, upon issuing the order sought
by attorneys fighting the rule.
   Vela set a hearing for 9 a.m. Thursday, when he said he would
consider converting the restraining order into an injunction against
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   Attorney David Ayala, representing the INS, had asked the judge
instead to delay considering the restraining order until Thursday to
give the government a chance to prepare further arguments.
   ``Your honor, the Immigration Service is not to blame for the
plight of the people who are out there,'' Ayala said.
   The judge's restraining order restores the right of asylum
seekers to travel farther into the United States and submit their
applications in the INS districts where they intend to live.
   Hundreds of Central American asylum seekers have set up camp in
the Rio Grande Valley to await the processing of their applications.
Some 300 applicants camping in a field near Brownsville have been
ordered to leave the primitive tent city by this afternoon because
it's private property.
   Today's ruling doesn't affect the property owner's order, except
that the 300 persons in the tent city would be free now to go to
another part of the United States.
   The 300 have been sleeping under sheets of plastic supported by
tree limbs for the past week in a field across the street from the
Casa Oscar Romero shelter for Central American refugees operated by
the Roman Catholic Church, which is filled to capacity.
   The INS policy, which was effective Dec. 16, also had limited the
aliens' ability to work during the waiting period while their asylum
applications were processed, at least 30 days.
   Previously, aliens who entered the country illegally in southern
Texas were allowed to pursue their asylum applications in other
cities, often Miami or Los Angeles.
   INS officials say the change was adopted to reduce huge case
backlogs in those cities and curb frivolous refugee claims. The INS
maintains that most of the 300,000 asylum applicants who passed
through the Harlingen District last year were ineligible for
political asylum because they merely wanted to better themselves
economically.
   The attorneys suing INS Commissioner Alan Nelson and U.S.
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh blame the 3-week-old procedure for
an increase in the number of Central Americans sleeping in condemned
buildings and camping with little or no shelter. Their federal
lawsuit was filed Friday.
   ``In essence, south Texas has been turned into a de facto
detention area and asylum applicants are trapped there,'' says the
suit filed on behalf of asylum-seekers by immigration attorney Linda
Reyna Yanez, Robert Rubin of the San Francisco Lawyers' Committee
for Urban Affairs and the Harlingen-based Proyecto Libertad
immigrant advocacy group.
   It accuses the INS of depriving immigrants of adequate access to
the asylum procedure as required by the Refugee Act of 1980, and of
implementing a policy change without publishing it in the Federal
Register for public comment.
   INS officials have declined comment on the lawsuit.
   Legal officer Susan Timberlake with the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees visited the tent city southeast of
Brownsville last Tuesday and said she witnessed ``difficulty and
hardship.''
   On Sunday, sheriff's deputies told those living on the
litter-strewn campsite that they had 24 hours to vacate the private
property or face trespassing charges.
   Cameron County Sheriff Alex Perez said authorities gave the order
to vacate after the property owner posted ``No Trespassing'' signs
in English and Spanish on Sunday afternoon.
   ``Maybe I'll sleep in some other field,'' said Gerardo Enrique
Perez, 19, of Honduras, as a rainy cold front blew into the area
Sunday night.
   The campers have been helped by area residents who have provide
food and clothing, but the field has no sanitary facilities.
   But some nearby residents said the growing campground made them
nervous.
   ``You don't know who these people are,'' said Alma Zieger,
manager of Paul's RV Park, who said the situation ``creates
uneasiness'' among the retirees making up the bulk of her tenants.

   _Budget discipline and lasting deficit reduction would be

appropriations committees, a common set of budget scoring principles
for use by the legislative and executive branches.

</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONCLUSION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The accomplishments of the American people in the past eight
years will always be for me a source of pride.
   However, we must continue our recent progress in reducing the
federal deficit.
   Deficit reduction is a key national priority, written into law by
the G-R-H Act, which, despite its defects, legislated a process to
achieve a balanced budget.
   This budget achieves the 1990 target of the amended act, and
projects a budget balance in 1993.
   It preserves legitimate programs for the aged and needy, provides
for adequate national security, devotes more resources to other
high-priority activities, and accomplishes all this without raising
taxes.
   Tax increases are not needed.
   History shows that they would simply be used by the Congress to
increase spending.
   Tax increases have been overwhelmingly voted down in the last
three presidential elections.
   I call upon the Congress to enact this budget.
   Higher taxes are not needed _ as this budget demonstrates _ but
genuine deficit reduction through moderating the growth in spending
is essential to enable the next administration and Congress to
address the nation's agenda for the future.
   Over the past eight years, we Americans have made our world a
safer place for freedom because we had the will to reinvigorate our
economy, rebuild our defenses, and provide for the less fortunate
among us.
   Together, we achieved a new beginning for our country and
prepared the way for the next administration to build on our
accomplishments.

<TEXT>
   An airplane on a military test flight
crashed minutes after takeoff from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
this morning, killing both occupants, a base spokeswoman said.
   An Air Force pilot and a civilian were aboard the two-seat XX-300
twin-engine plane owned by Jaffe Corp. of San Antonio, Texas, said
Wright-Patterson spokeswoman Kathy Higgins.
   Ms. Higgins said the civilian in the plane was a representative
of Jaffe, the plane's manufacturer.
   Neither the Air Force nor the State Highway Patrol, which was
investigating the crash, knew which victim was flying the aircraft.
Names of the dead were not immediately released pending notification
of relatives, Ms. Higgins said.
   The turbo-prop plane was being demonstrated to officials at
Wright-Patterson as a possible replacement for the T-37, which the
Air Force plans to replace as its primary training vehicle.
   The plane departed from Wright-Patterson about 8:55 a.m. and
disappeared from base radar screens nine minutes later, Ms. Higgins
said. The wreckage was found in a rural area in northwestern Clinton
County, about 17 miles southwest of Wright-Patterson.

<TEXT>
   Both engines on a brand-new Boeing 737
apparently failed before the plane crashed along a highway, killing
46 people, officials said today. Aviation experts said the chances
of double-engine failure were about 10 million to one.
   ``So far the evidence, although by no means conclusive, is
consistent with the right engine having stopped before impact and
there are also signs of fire in the left engine,'' Transport
Minister Paul Channon said in an interview on British Broadcasting
Corp. television.
   Olivier Fagard, a spokesman for the company that makes the CFM-56
engines the jet used, told The Associated Press, ``It is extremely
improbable that both motors would break down in such a short
interval.''
   ``We have very impressive reliability statistics,'' said Fagard,
of the French company SNECMA, which builds the engines in consortium
with General Electric Co. ```We don't know. It has been established
that there was no fire in second motor. But we don't know any more
than that,'' he said.
   Officials raised the number of confirmed dead to 46 late today.
Eighty people were injured.
   Investigators recovered the flight recorders from the wreckage,
and firefighters pumped foam onto the crumpled jet to prevent
seeping aviation fuel from catching fire.
   The Belfast-bound British Midland Airways jet carrying 126 people
broke into three pieces on the edge of Britain's main north-south
highway, the M1, in central England on Sunday night.
   The twin-engine Boeing 737-400 narrowly missed the town of
Kegworth and plowed into an embankment a few hundred yards short of
the runway as the pilot struggled to make an emergency landing at
East Midland Airport, 100 miles north of London.
   Ham radio operator Mervyn Solloway said he heard ``not a shouted
message, but a bit of a frantic one to say, `We've got problems with
the other engine.' That was the last I heard from the aircraft.''
   British Midland Airways said sabotage was not suspected in the
crash, which came less than three weeks after a bomb blew apart Pan
Am Flight 103 over the Scottish village of Lockerbie, killing all
259 people on board and 11 on the ground.
   But Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who flew to the scene and
visited survivors at Derby Hospital, said: ``We rule out nothing, we
simply can't. There will be a lot of speculation, but until we have
the facts it is unsafe for me to speculate.''
   Asked about terrorism, Channon replied: ``I don't rule out
anything at this stage but there's certainly no evidence of it.''
   William Tench, retired head of Britain's Air Accident
Investigation Board, said the odds against both engines failing on a
Boeing 737 were 10 million to one.
   ``I would look for some inadvertent technical mistake such as
something incorrect being done to the engines during turnaround,
either inadvertently or deliberately,'' Tench said.
   British Midland said the jet was delivered just 12 weeks ago and
had flown less than 500 hours. It grounded its other 737-400 for
inspection.
   Pilot Kevin Hunt, a 25-year veteran, was among the badly injured
cut from the wreckage. The last survivor, a woman, was pulled from a
tangle of metal and crushed seats more than seven hours after the
crash.
   The plane's two giant wings, heavily loaded with fuel, remained
virtually intact. The severed tail section of Flight BD92 loomed
from woodland alongside the highway, surrounded by wreckage from the
severed center and nose sections.
   ``It makes you wonder how anybody walked from it,'' said
Leicestershire county Chief Fire Officer Barry Pearson.
   Survivor John McCrea said passengers were being served dinner
when the plane got into trouble soon after takeoff from London's
Heathrow Airport.
   ``The captain said `prepare for emergency landing' or something
to that effect, so we braced our heads and about five seconds ...
afterward we were down on the ground with a crash,'' McCrea said
from his bed at the Derby Royal Infirmary in nearby Nottingham.
   Belfast lawyer Mary McHugh, 26, another survivor, said: ``I
thought we were all going to get burned alive. I just thought:
`That's it, I'm dead.' I was terrified of burning to death.''
   At least four British Army soldiers serving in the troubled
Northern Ireland province were killed. The Royal Ulster
Constabulary, the Northern Ireland police force, said several of its
officers were on board.
   As East Midland Airport, the airline's home base, reopened today,
55 relatives of the dead and injured were flown in from Belfast.
   The plane took off at 7:52 p.m., and about eight minutes later
the captain reported ``severe vibrations in one of the engines,''
said British Midland Chairman Michael Bishop.
   Hunt reported an engine on fire, then said he had it under
control and asked for clearance for an emergency landing. Witnesses
said the left engine was on fire as the pilot undershot the runway
by about half a mile and crashed at 8:26 p.m.

<TEXT>
   The tobacco industry, in newspaper ads running
around the country Monday, touted a survey indicating three of four
Americans don't support workplace or restaurant smoking bans.
   The industry's counter-initiative through its lobbying
organization, the Tobacco Institute, comes during the week marking
the 25th anniversary of the first of the surgeon generals' reports
to declare smoking a health hazard.
   A spokeswoman for the institute, Brennan Dawson, noted some
anti-smoking groups are pushing for a ``smoke-free'' society. ``To
achieve their purposes,'' she said, ``anti-smokers are turning to
censorship, harassment, punitive taxes and intrusion into personal
and private decision-making.''
   ``The majority of Americans, according to objective polling, do
not support these anti-smoking efforts,'' she said.
   The institute's poll was conducted by the Washington firm of
Hamilton, Frederick &amp; Schneiders, which said it randomly telephoned
1,500 Americans over age 18 between Nov. 23 and Dec. 6, 1988. The
respondents included 1,099 nonsmokers and 401 smokers, the firm said.
   An overwhelming number of those polled indicated they are
satisfied with current levels of smoking restrictions, and opposed
outright bans in the workplace or public areas. The survey has a
margin of error of plus or minus three points.
   Among the findings:
   _Eight of 10 people believe it should be left to employers and
their employees to determine workplace smoking rules without
government interference.
   _About 74 percent believe restaurants should be allowed to offer
smoking and non-smoking sections to customers.
   _Fifty-three percent believe excise taxes _ amounting to about a
third of the price of a pack of cigarettes _ should stay the same
(38 percent) or be reduced (15 percent).
   _Fifty-seven percent believe cigarette advertising restrictions
should remain the same (38 percent) or be lifted entirely (23
percent), as opposed to banning all advertising.
   The institute's newspaper ads declared ``Enough is enough!'' and
said that meant ``enough taxation ... enough legislation ... enough
control ... enough censorship ... enough harassment ... enough
discrimination'' against smokers.

   Joe Weston-Webb heard the jet come low
over his home and instantly thought of Lockerbie. There was a crash,
stunned silence, then screams from passengers trapped inside a web
of smashed seats.
   ``It was horrendous,'' he said. ``It seems a miracle that any one
got out alive ... and I can't believe that it all didn't go up in
flames.''
   The British Midland Airways Boeing 737-400 jet, with 126 people
aboard, crashed beside the main north-south highway in central
England Sunday as it attempted an emergency landing at East Midlands
Airport. Officials said both engines apparently had failed.
   The second air disaster in Britain in less than three weeks sent
a collective shudder through this village of 2,000 on the edge of
the airport as residents remembered the Scottish town of Lockerbie
and the Dec. 21 crash of Pan Am Flight 103.
   All 259 people aboard that Boeing 747 died when a bomb ripped the
plane apart in the air, and 11 people in Lockerbie were killed by
falling wreckage.
   ``We have been very lucky,'' said George Mellors, 46, another
Kegworth resident. ``It could easily have been another Lockerbie.''
   David Harris ran into his garden and watched in horror as the
plane flew 60 feet over his head and crashed nearby, turning the
night sky red.
   ``Thoughts of Lockerbie came into my mind,'' he said. ``The pilot
did well to avoid our built-up area in Kegworth village. It was only
seconds away from hitting the center of the community.''
   Flight 92 from London to Belfast hit an embankment on the side of
the M1 highway about a half-mile from the airport and broke in
pieces. At least 46 people died.
   Rachel Meadows, 19, of Derby, said she saw the plane come down
just yards away as she was driving on the highway.
   ``It seemed to clip the embankment on one side of the motorway
and then just bounce across before it plowed into the trees. There
was an almighty flash but it didn't explode. A lot of cars on the
motorway began to brake hard. I thought it was going to be a massive
pileup but luckily no cars were hit by the plane.''
   Weston-Webb, 50, of nearby Sutton Bonningale, was one of the
first on the scene.
   When he arrived, everthing was silent. ``People started screaming
later,'' he said.
   ``The seats were all slapped on top of each other where they had
gone forward. And the seats had all gone forward toward the cockpit
end and the people had all been shunted together. There were people
in a sort of concertina, you had to take the seats from the back of
the people in front to get them out,'' Weston-Webb said.
   Many seemed to have smashed ankles and legs and facial injuries,
he said.
   Police Inspector Graham Ward said: ``It was a terrible sight.
Everything was done to pull people out as quickly as possible. We
had to flatten trees across fields to get to the plane.''
   More than seven hours after the crash, passengers were still
trapped in the wreckage.
   The Episcopal Rev. Michael Brandon, 32, said prayers for the
victims.
   ``I held one man's hand as he died and I whispered the Lord's
Prayer _ what more can you do?''

   Peter Falk will return to television as
``Columbo'' on Feb. 6, ABC announced Monday.
   Falk made the rumpled detective a household name in the 1970s,
and ABC announced last year that he had signed on for a revival of
the series. The new ``Columbo'' was to have begun in the fall, but
the writers strike delayed production.
   A series of two-hour ``Columbo'' movies will rotate Monday nights
with two other movies: ``B.L. Stryker,'' starring Burt Reynolds as a
Florida private eye, premieres on Feb. 13; and ``Gideon Oliver,''
starring Oscar-winner Louis Gossett Jr. (``An Officer and a
Gentleman'') as a crime-solving anthropologist, makes its debut Feb.
20.
   ABC also announced Monday that it will rebroadcast ``The Day
After,'' the made-for-TV movie about a nuclear war and its
aftermath, on Jan. 23. ``The Day After'' remains the highest-rated
made-for-TV movie ever. When it first aired in January 1983, it had
a rating of 46.0, an estimated 100 million viewers.

   Voters may think it's time that Coleman Young
stepped down as mayor, but they are not ready to replace him with
singer Stevie Wonder, according to a poll published Monday.
   The Detroit Free Press said its survey found Young tied with
Thomas Barrow, his 1985 opponent, but holding substantial leads over
seven other potential rivals, including Wonder, who has expressed
interest in the job.
   Barrow, an accountant and the nephew of boxing great Joe Louis,
led the successful opposition to casino gambling in the city, an
idea long promoted by the mayor.
   The Free Press published the poll in two parts, beginning Sunday
when it reported that Young and Barrow were deadlocked at 42
percent, with 16 percent undecided. The poll of 500 registered
voters had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
   Monday's installment matched Young against other prominent
Detroit figures. He led them all by decisive margins.
   Wonder, who has said he would like to run for mayor but has not
expressed an interest in challenging Young, was the choice of 21
percent to Young's 57 percent.
   On Sunday, both the Free Press and The Detroit News released
surveys indicating that a majority of voters don't think Young, 70,
should run for re-election this year.
   Young, a Democrat first elected in 1973, has not formally
announced his candidacy but has told associates he will seek a fifth
term as mayor of the nation's sixth-largest city, both newspapers
said.

   Transport workers walked off the job to
protest the arrest of six union leaders, and thousands of commuters
across the country were stranded, police said Monday.
   More than 30,000 buses, vans, trucks and other vehicles making up
two-thirds of the nation's public transport system halted services
Sunday, said a police official on condition of anonymity.
   At least 200 people were injured slightly by strikers who threw
stones at buses that did not observe the stoppage, said the official.
   The strike followed the arrests Saturday of union leaders accused
of instigating violence during agitation to demand the shifting of a
bus terminal from a northern suburb of Dhaka to the city center,
according to the official.
   Protesters also demanded an end to what they called forcible
collection of illegal tolls, which they said went to the ruling
Jatiya Party.

   France told the Security Council today that
all parties should show restraint following the U.S. downing of two
Libyan MiGs over the Mediterranean Sea last week.
   ``We hope everyone will exercise restraint and refrain from any
act which could enhance tensions,'' said French envoy Pierre
Brochand, the deputy permanent representative.
   Brochand spoke at an emergency session convened to discuss
Libya's demand that the United States be condemned for shooting down
the planes Wednesday.
   The United States said the planes were armed and dangerous. Libya
said they were unarmed and on a reconnaissance mission.
   France, the first U.S. ally to speak in the debate, did not
support or criticize either side and is expected to abstain when the
Security Council votes on the issue, probably Wednesday.
   Also speaking today were Finland, Ethiopia, Senegal, Sudan,
India, Morocco and Bangladesh. The session then adjourned until
Tuesday, when a resolution was expected to be submitted.
   Except for France, major U.S. allies like Britain have not spoken
and virtually all speakers have denounced or criticized the U.S.
action.
   ``France deeply regrets the incident between Libyan and U.S. air
forces,'' Brochand said. ``Our country, which borders the
Mediterranean, is particularly concerned about the maintenance of
stability and peace in that region.''
   Finnish Ambassador Klaus Tornudd also urged restraint. He noted
that Libya said its aircraft were on routine reconnaissance and the
United States said its planes were on a routine training mission.
   ``There must be something wrong with the routines if this is the
result,'' he said.
   He said there was a need for an international code of conduct
covering international naval forces and aircraft.
   On Friday, U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters exhibited two
enlarged photographs that he said proved the Libyan warplanes were
armed with missiles. Libya called the photographs fabrications.
   U.S. officials said the two photographs showed one of the two
Libyan aircraft. Blurred spots were under the wings and on the
fuselage, and the United States said the spots indicate missiles.
   The Soviet Union and other nations said the photographs were too
blurred to prove the planes were armed.
   Last week, 17 speakers, mostly Arab and developing nations,
condemned the U.S. action as premeditated aggression.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, speaking to
reporters today in Paris, said he told Secretary of State George
Shultz that ``the most important thing is to stabilize the situation
after the air incident.''
   Shevardnadze and Shultz have been in Paris for an international
conference on chemical weapons.
   Earlier, Soviet Ambassador Alexander M. Belonogov, the permanent
U.N. representative, deplored the U.S. action in the Mediterranean
and said it hurt possibilities for Middle East peace.
   The United States and Britain are expected to veto any resolution
criticizing the U.S. action. The five permanent members with veto
power can kill any resolution on the 15-member council.
   The other permanent members are China, France and the Soviet
Union.

<TEXT>
   A court on Monday convicted a former employee of a
U.S.-run Nazi document center for his role in the theft of thousands
of files from the facility.
   The court sentenced Alfred Darko, former head of the center's
photographic department, to two years and four months in prison.
Three other defendants _ all Germans _ also were convicted and given
suspended sentences.
   Darko, a native of the Ivory Coast, was found guilty of stealing
4,000 Nazi files and selling them to dealers for up to $22,000.
   Chief judge Clemens Basdorf did not order Darko to prison
immediately. Darko, who has spent nine months in investigative
custody and who is reported to be in ill health, was ordered not to
leave West Berlin and to report to police once a week.
   Basdorf said Darko was not the only employee suspected in the
thefts, but he added that Darko had refused to identify individuals
he said stole the documents.
   ``Darko knows the truth, but we don't know why he will not name
the accomplices,'' Basdorf said.
   More than 10,000 documents are believed to be missing from the
center.
   The Berlin Document Center contains 30 million Nazi files seized
by the Allies after World War II. Among the documents are personnel
files of prominent Nazis and an almost complete list of Nazi Party
members.
   The thefts were discovered last year.
   Among the documents stolen was the personnel file of former
Gestapo officer Klaus Barbie, known as the Butcher of Lyon, who is
serving a life sentence in France for war crimes.
   A marriage request by SS officer Adolf Eichmann was also among
the documents stolen. Eichmann was executed in Israel after being
convicted of playing a major role in the Nazi deportation and murder
of millions of Jews.
   The court on Monday also found three other men guilty.
   A Hamburg military documents dealer, Andre Huesken, was sentenced
to two years' probation and fined $27,000 for selling many of the
documents to clients around the world.
   Two West Berlin antique dealers, Alfred Borrmann and Henry
Berger, also were given suspended sentences and fined for their
roles in delivering and selling the documents to dealers and
collectors.

   The U.N. organization said it spent $136 million for almost
550,000 tons of food in 1988, a 42 percent spending increase over
1987.
   The bigger expenditure reflects higher prices due to unfavorable

<TEXT>
   A group of black Americans vowed Monday to
revitalize efforts to promote closer ties between the administration
of President-elect George Bush and African nations.
   The African American Institute, meeting in Lusaka, sought a
greater understanding of African problems in the United States,
according to Randolph Nugent, the chairman of the institute's board
of trustees.
   Nugent told about 175 conferees in a welcoming address that the
institute believed U.S. administrations viewed Africa from a
short-term perspective.
   ``Our aim is to help bring Americans and Africans together to
help America take a long-term view of African problems,'' he said.
   Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda opened the four-day gathering by
urging world nations to focus more attention on the African debt
crisis.
   He cited burgeoning debt and South Afrca's policy of apartheid as
the ``root cause'' of conflict and suffering on the continent of 550
million people.
   Kaunda said many of the world's most heavily indebted nations
were in Africa but little was done by developed countries to offest
their loan burden.
   Between 1985 and 1987, African nations relying on exports of raw
materials for hard currency income lost an estimated $50 billion
through depressed commodity prices on world markets, he said.
   He chided unspecified Western nations for failing to impose
tougher trade sanctions against South Africa to end apartheid. Some
Western leaders argue that sanctions would harden white South
African resistance to change and hurt blacks the most.
   Among conferees from the United States and 17 African nations was
the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., chairman of the African Affairs
subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is expected
in Lusaka on Tuesday.
   The New York-based African American Institute holds a convention
in Africa every two years.

   The 1989 Wolf Foundation Prize in mathematics
was awarded to two Americans for their work in theoretical
mathematics and geometry, the foundation announced Monday.
   The $100,000 prize is to be shared by Alberto P. Calderon of the
University of Chicago and John W. Milnor of Princeton University.
   Calderon, born in Mendoza, Argentina, was cited for his
``groundbreaking work'' on differential equations, the foundation
said.
   Milnor, of Orange, N.J., was selected for his ``highly original
discoveries in geometry which have opened important new vistas,'' it
said.
   The prizes will be presented to Calderon and Milnor in May by
President Chaim Herzog.
   The privately run Wolf Foundation grants six annual awards of
$100,000 each in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine,
agriculture, mathematics and the arts. The other prizes are to be
announced later.
   The $12 million foundation was established in 1975 by Dr. Ricardo
Wolf, a German-born chemist and diplomat who emigrated to Cuba and
in 1961 became Cuba's ambassador to Israel. He lived in Israel until
his death in 1981.

   Aeron Clement, who wrote a successful book about

   Clement died Sunday of complications from a heart bypass
operation six weeks earlier, said Bernard Kindred, a friend.
   ``The Cold Moons,'' which concentrates on one badger family, was
a success in paperback last year after major publishers had rejected
it.
   Penguin Books bought the publishing rights for $248,000 after
Clement and Kindred formed a company to publish the book and a first
print run of 5,000 quickly sold out.
   Clement had been working on a sequel about the threat to badgers'
survival when he died.
   He was born in Swansea, Wales, trained as an accountant, and
began writing after heart attacks forced him into early retirement.
He took up watching wildlife, especially badgers, around his home in
Llandeilo.
   Clement will be buried Thursday in Llandeilo. He is survived by
his wife and two daughters.

   Polish tourists sold $1 million in
vodka, Russian champagne and caviar on the black market in Sweden
last year, a newspaper reported Monday.
   The smuggled goods sold in the southern port city of Malmo last
year averaged up to $200 for each of the 50,000 Polish tourists who
visited the city, according to the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. The
goods also included crab, ham, clothes, crystal and amber worth $170

   Police inspector Jonte Sterup was quoted as saying the Poles used
most of the money to buy U.S. dollars before they return home.

   Six in 10 Americans say homelessness afflicts
their own communities, and a majority would pay higher federal taxes
to help ease the problem, a Media General-Associated Press poll has
found.
   The national survey found wide agreement that homelessness is a
serious and worsening problem and general dissatisfaction with the
level of the federal government's response.
   Sixty percent of the respondents favored more federal spending
for the homeless, with nearly all in that group saying they would
pay higher taxes for that purpose.
   Accordingly, respondents rated the problem as extraordinarily
severe. Sixty-eight percent called it ``very serious'' and 24
percent said ``fairly serious.''
   The poll also exhibited the broad reach of homelessness:
Three-quarters said the problem plagues communities of all sizes,
not just big cities, and 59 percent said there were homeless people
in their own communities.
   The telephone survey, conducted among 1,084 randomly selected
adults Nov. 10-20, had a margin of error of plus or minus three
percentage points.
   The poll was completed before the holiday season and winter cold
refocused attention on the homeless. Still, 68 percent said
homelessness was worsening, just a quarter said it was unchanged and
a scant 3 percent saw improvement.
   A plurality said homelessness is primarily society's fault,
rather than the fault of the homeless themselves. Approaches such as
more housing for the homeless and subsidized apartments for the poor
won strong support.
   Views were divided on who is responsible for solutions. A 32
percent plurality said the federal government was chiefly
responsible for helping homeless people; 24 percent said state
governments; 18 percent said local governments; and 9 percent said
private charities. The rest had no opinion.
   Wherever prime responsibility lies, only 27 percent said the
federal government does enough to prevent people from becoming
homeless, and 58 percent said it does not. The remaining 15 percent
had no answer.
   Of the 60 percent who favored increasing federal spending on
programs for the homeless, 86 percent said they would be willing to
pay higher taxes for that purpose. Overall, 52 percent said they
would pay more to help the homeless.
   On specific programs, 62 percent said the federal government
should spend more on housing for the homeless, and 65 percent
favored the preventive measure of building more federally-subsidized
housing.
   Majorities of all groups favored subsidized housing, including
those least likely to support federal spending _ Republicans and
conservatives. In virtually all measures, however, homelessness was
seen as a problem by greater shares of women, Democrats, liberals,
minorities, lower-income respondents and younger people. They also
were more apt to blame society and to favor a broader federal
response.
   For example, 78 percent of women rated the problem as ``very
serious,'' compared with 56 percent of men. Eighty-three percent of
Democrats said it was getting worse, compared with 54 percent of
Republicans. And sixty-four percent of liberals said society was at
fault, compared with 37 percent of conservatives.
   Of those with family incomes under $25,000 a year, 73 percent
favored more subsidized housing for the poor; of those earning more
than $50,000, just 54 percent agreed.
   Respondents were divided on whether homeless people should be
allowed to live on the streets. Fifty-one percent said people should
not be allowed to live on the streets if they want to, but 45
percent said they should have that right.
   On the root cause of homelessness, 45 percent said society mainly
is at fault and 33 percent said the homeless themselves are chiefly
to blame. The rest, 22 percent, had no answer.

   The News Letter, the Belfast
daily that claims to be the world's oldest surviving
English-language newspaper, is to be sold, it was announced Monday.
   The Belfast Telegraph, a Belfast evening paper, said it would buy
the News Letter, its sister weekly the Sunday News, and two other
local free papers.
   The News Letter was founded in September 1737, although its
oldest surviving issue is from March 1738, and it prides itself on
being the first newspaper to report the American Declaration of
Independence on this side of the Atlantic.
   A morning daily since 1855, the paper has a circulation of 43,700
and is the voice of Northern Ireland Unionism _ the preservation of
the province's union with Britain and opposition to uniting the
island under rule from Dublin, capital of the Irish Republic.
   Capt. Bill Henderson, chairman of Century Newspapers, which owns
the News Letter, said the newspaper would remain ``the responsible
voice of Unionism in Ulster'' under the ownership of the
non-partisan Belfast Telegraph.
   Henderson said the company had needed massive capital investment,
new presses and computer systems, and the cost put the future of the
papers in doubt. He said he agreed to sell after the buyer
guaranteed to maintain the News Letter as a Unionist paper and to
invest in its future.
   The sale price was withheld pending government approval.

<TEXT>
   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews Nov. 10-20 with 1,084 adults in the
continental United States. The phone numbers were selected randomly
by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the
most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that if every
adult American were asked the same questions the results
theoretically would be within three points of the poll's results, 19
times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ four
points for women, for example, and five for Democrats.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. In your opinion, how serious a problem is homelessness in the
United States? Is it very serious, fairly serious, not too serious,
or not serious at all? Very: 68 percent. Fairly: 24. Not too: 5. Not

   2. Do you think the problem of homelessness is getting worse,
improving, or staying about the same? Worse: 68. Improving: 3. Same:
24. DK-NA: 5.
   3. Who do you think should be primarily responsible for helping
homeless people _ the federal government, state government, local
government or private charities? Federal: 32. State: 24. Local: 18.
Charity: 9. DK-NA: 17.
   4. Do you think federal spending on helping the homeless should
be increased, decreased or remain the same? Increased: 60.
Decreased: 6. Same: 27. DK-NA: 7.
   a. (If increased) Would you be willing to pay more taxes for
that? Yes: 86. No: 11. DK-NA: 3.
   5. Thinking about why most people are homeless, would you say
society is mainly at fault, or the homeless personally are mainly at
fault? Society: 45. Homeless: 33. DK-NA: 22.
   6. Do you think homelessness is a problem only in big cities, or
in communities of all sizes? Cities: 24. All sizes: 74. DK-NA: 2.
   7. Does the federal government do enough to prevent people from
becoming homeless, or not? Yes: 27. No: 58. DK-NA: 15.

   A trial of avowed revolutionaries that
has already cost the government millions of dollars moved toward
opening arguments almost a year after lawyers began selecting jurors.
   The three remaining defendants of eight who were captured in one
of the largest manhunts in U.S. history are accused of sedition, or
conspiring to topple the government by force, under a rarely invoked
law whose meaning has been the subject of much courtroom wrangling.
   ``It is a serious threat to fundamental liberties,'' said Peter
Avenia, one of six defense lawyers.
   Prosecutors contend, however, that the charge of sedition fits
the group they describe as a dangerous band of terrorists. A Boston
courthouse worker lost a leg and 21 other people were wounded in one
of the score of bombings the group allegedly plotted from 1976 to
1985.
   Jury selection began last March with a vast pool of jurors.
Selection of the final few jurors in the U.S. District Court trial
wound up this morning with the seating of 12 jurors and five
alternates. Opening arguments were slated to begin Tuesday.
   Up to 350 witnesses could be called. A closed-circuit camera has
been installed with monitors in another room in case defendants are
ejected for unruliness. Observers must pass through two metal
detectors to reach the courtroom, which an estimated 40 marshals
take turns guarding.
   The defendants each face up to 60 years in prison and $60,000 in
fines if convicted on the charges of seditious conspiracy,
racketeering conspiracy and racketeering enterprise.
   Their attorneys argue that the trial is a waste of money because
their clients already have been convicted on bombing and bank
robbery charges and all but one are serving prison sentences. The
cost so far is estimated at well over $3 million.
   The defense attorneys say the seditious conspiracy statute is so
broad that it could be used against protesters blocking streets.
   ``If people engage in political dissent and think this can't
happen to them, they should read the statute,'' said Avenia.
   The statute makes it a crime for ``two or more persons in any
state or territory to conspire to overthrow or put down or destroy
by force the government of the United States.''
   The government has used the statute only a few times since it was
first invoked to punish Confederates during the Civil War, said
Arthur D. Wolf, a professor at Western New England College in
Springfield.
   It was used to keep protesters from hindering the draft during
World War I and to prosecute Puerto Rican nationalists accused in an
assassination attempt against then-President Harry Truman. Last
April, nine white supremacists were acquitted of seditious
conspiracy charges in Arkansas.
   In the case going to trial here, an FBI hunt for the defendants
swept through hundreds of towns in Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Vermont, Connecticut, New York and Ohio in 1983.
   Arrested in their Cleveland house on Nov. 4, 1984, were Jaan
Laaman, 40; his wife, Barbara J. Curzi-Laaman, 31; and Richard
Williams, 41. Agents in Deerfield, Ohio, arrested Raymond Luc
Levasseur, 42, and his wife, Patricia Gros Levasseur, 34, the same
day. Carol A. Manning, 33, and her husband, Thomas Manning, 42, were
apprehended six months later in Norfolk, Va. Christopher King, 38,
was arrested in North Attleboro in 1982.
   The federal trial was moved to Springfield in 1987 so that
defendants could be housed together at a jail in nearby Hartford,
Conn.
   The only defendants, however, are Williams and the Levasseurs.
The five others either have changed their pleas to guilty or been
dropped from the case. Mrs. Levasseur is out on bail, having
finished a five-year term for possessing false identification and
harboring her fugitive husband.
   King was tried separately in 1987. He pleaded guilty that
December to one count of seditious conspiracy and was sentenced to
seven years in prison.
   In August, the government dropped charges against Manning and
Laaman, saying Manning already was serving 53 years and Laaman, 45
years, for bombings. Manning also got a life sentence for the 1981
shooting death of a New Jersey state trooper.
   Mrs. Manning pleaded guilty two weeks ago to all three counts.
She was sentenced to five years, to be served concurrently with her
15-year term on bombing charges.
   On Friday, the First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a decision
suppressing evidence against Mrs. Curzi-Laaman because it was seized
without a search warrant. The decision meant she would be tried
separately. She is serving a 15-year sentence.

   Police in the central Yugoslav
republic of Bosnia have discovered a cache of firearms and
ammunition ``used by terrorists,'' media reports said Monday.
   Authorities in Sarajevo, the republic's capital, said the find
included a U.S.-made automatic rifle, four pistols, eight revolvers
and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, reports said.
   The newspaper, Borba, quoted police as saying the weapons and
ammunition were of the kind ``most often used by terrorists.''
   To date, officials have refused to identify a man detained before
the New Year's holidays on allegations of trying to smuggle the
rifle and four pistols into the country.
   A subsequent search of his home yielded the remaining arms, Borba
reported.
   The police statement did not identify the terrorist group to
which the detained man is accused of belonging. However, leaflets
and publications of banned Croatian nationalist groups were shown
with the state TV report on the arms cache.
   Croatian extremists have been blamed for several bombings and
attacks in Yugoslavia in the past 20 years.

   Television portrayals of lawyers as
``aggressive, loud, obnoxious persons who insult judges'' is
ungentle- manly and -womanly, and the Kentucky Bar Association wants
to be sure life doesn't imitate TV.
   The association has decreed that Kentucky's lawyers should be
courteous in the courtroom and friendly with their colleagues and
that the lawyers should never intentionally mislead or deceive their
adversaries.
   The Code of Professional Courtesy, endorsed by the association's
governing board in September, carries no penalties.
   But George Long II, the association's president, said it will
remind lawyers to watch their Ps and Qs.
   Long acknowledged that the law inherently involves conflict. But
he said it should be practiced courteously.
   Richard Frymire, head of the association's Committee on Lawyer
Professionalism, which drafted the code, said it is designed to
counter television portrayals of lawyers as ``aggressive, loud,
obnoxious persons who insult judges'' _ and a growing sense that is
how real lawyers are supposed to behave.
   ``I think it's terrible that a profession like the law has to
have this type of code imposed,'' said Martin Johnstone, the chief
Jefferson Circuit Court judge. ``But from what I've seen over the
past few years, I think it's necessary.''
   Still, some practitioners say the code may clash with more
important ethical requirements, and describe it as vague and even
silly.
   ``Why do we have to be friendly?'' asked Louisville lawyer C.
Thomas Hectus. ``Am I supposed to inquire as to how are the wife and
kids?''
   Writing in the association's magazine, Bench &amp; Bar, U.S. District
Judge William Bertelsman said lawyers have become ``more aggressive
and harder to get along with.'' He said judges must devote
increasing time to refereeing abusive tactics that range from
``benign incivility to outright obstruction.''
   ``I absolutely believe a lawyer can zealously represent clients
and abide by all precepts'' of the code, said Frymire.

   Take his land. Please.
   Robert Luther has 1.2 acres of land, zoned for development, that
he can't sell or even give away. In the meantime, he has to keep
paying taxes that were $1,275 last year.
   The Smithfield resident inherited the parcel in 1985 from his
brother. It is zoned for industry in an area where there has been
considerable recent development. But 80 percent is swampland, and
any alteration for construction requires federal and state consent.
   ``I've had a couple of people look at it, but when they have had
engineers look at it they decided to forget it,'' he said. Two
engineering firms hired by Luther have said the land is unsuitable
for construction in its present state.
   Luther then tried to give it to Providence College, his alma
mater, but they weren't interested.
   So he tried to give it to the town, but the town council isn't
welcoming the offer with open arms either.
   ``You don't look a gift horse in the mouth,'' said Town Council
President Anthony B. Simeone. But the council wants to study the
matter.
   Luther said some have suggested he just stop paying taxes, in
which case the town would seize it and try to recoup the lost taxes
at a tax sale. Luther said he'll wait to hear from the town council
before deciding his next move.

   Tyrone Nelson thought he heard an explosion
Monday morning and jumped from beneath the covers only to find a car
hanging over his bed.
   His wife, Darlene, 36, sustained leg injuries when she was hit by
the front end of the car that crashed into their first-floor bedroom
and by debris that filled the room. She was treated at the Greater
Baltimore Medical Center and released, police said. Nelson was
unhurt.
   Officer Greg Taylor said a Baltimore County Police officer was
following a suspected stolen car when the car went out of control,
moved along a 100-foot grass strip and then crashed into the
apartment.
   Just before the crash, Officer Richard Theis lost control of his
car as well and hit a fence, but was uninjured.
   In the confusion, the driver of the car that hit the apartment
escaped, although the transmission of the car landed in the Nelsons'
bathroom and the force of the impact left a gaping hole in a bedroom
wall, shattered windows and mirrors and disrupted electrical power.
   Police said the intruding car had been registered to a dealership.

   The three sneaked into the home of Masataro Kawaguchi, owner of a

   Hearing screams, Kawaguchi's son rushed from a second-floor

   Japanese newspapers said the three arrived in Japan on Friday as

   The official said police arrested two of the men on the street

   The Legislature doesn't convene until later
this month, but members have already begun tackling one of the
toughest issues _ office space.
   It's a cutthroat political game, played like this: Legislative
leaders get the best offices, veteran legislators fight over the
leaders' old offices and new members scramble for whatever's left.
   Rep. Marlin Schneider of Wisconsin Rapids, who's in charge of
office assignments, humorously threatened to call in an air strike
by the Wisconsin National Guard unless warring factions in the
Capitol's north wing resolved their own territorial dispute.
   In the same spirit, he proposed capital punishment _ and
something worse than that _ for legislators who try to make off with
their old office furniture.
   ``Failure to cooperate may result in death by firing squad, or no
pork for you in the budget,'' he warned colleagues in a memorandum
on unauthorized furniture moving.
   But even that dire threat didn't keep Rep. Joseph Wineke of
Verona from moving his desk chair from his old office to his new one.
   ``I stole that chair personally years ago, and I'm keeping it,''
Wineke said.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said Monday he will
seek passage of legislation to deny foreign chemical companies
access to U.S. markets if they are found to have assisted in the
proliferation of chemical weapons.
   Nickles said the bill will be an effort ``to put some teeth'' in
a proposed international agreement banning the use, storage and
production of chemical weapons worldwide.
   ``This is an effort to make sure that if we do catch them we
would do something about it,'' said Nickles, noting that certain
West German chemical companies are alleged to have helped Iraq and
Libya attain chemical warfare capability.
   Nickles, who attended the ongoing conference on chemical weapons
in Paris, told a news conference that while he found the meeting
helpful, he continues to believe that ``the utopian goal of banning
nuclear weapons will be close to impossible.''
   He said that events like the use of poison gas in the Iran-Iraq
war show that even some signers of the 1925 international agreement
banning the use of chemical weapons have clearly violated it.
   ``Measures are lacking that would impose some penalties if
countries don't comply,'' he said. ``We have to have some teeth
behind these treaties.''
   He said he will seek passage, in partnership with Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, of legislation imposing
sanctions on individual companies involved in chemical weapons
proliferation.

   The savage beating death of a pregnant
33-year-old physician at Bellevue Hospital has triggered a major
police investigation and a review of security at the shaken
institution, officials said.
   ``This is a major case and at least 50 detectives are assigned to
it,'' Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said after the body of Dr.
Kathryn Hinnant was found in a laboratory office Sunday morning by
her husband.
   Authorities today said that Ms. Hinnant had been raped and robbed
of $75 and a mink coat.
   ``It was a particularly brutal, outrageous murder,'' said Mayor
Edward I. Koch, who termed it a ``No. 1 case to be solved.''
   The city offered a $30,000 reward for information.
   Officials said security at the 1,200-bed municipal hospital would
be reviewed, but an initial check found nothing out of the ordinary
at the time of the murder.
   Her husband, Eric Johnson, 33, a piano salesman, said she was
five months pregnant. Police have said he is not a suspect.
   Officials said he was not unduly worried at first when his wife
didn't return from work Saturday evening. But when she did not call
or come home overnight, Johnson went to the hospital Sunday morning.
He and a hospital administrator found Ms. Hinnant's body in a small,
fourth-floor office.
   Hinnant, a native of Columbia, S.C., was a 1982 graduate of the
Medical University of South Carolina and had worked in Washington
before coming to Bellevue in 1987, police said.

   Here are excerpts from the text of the budget
message which President Reagan sent to Congress on Monday.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Eight years ago many in this country were concerned about the
future of our economy, our government and, indeed, the nation
itself. ...
   To resolve the economic problems then facing us, our
administration proposed a recovery program centering on four
fundamental principles:
   _Reduce personal and business tax rates.
   _Reduce the rate of growth of federal spending.
   _Reduce the federal regulatory burden by eliminating unnecessary
restrictions while protecting the public's interest and safety.
   _Support a moderate and steady monetary policy to bring inflation
under control.
   To rebuild our defense capabilities and restore America's
standing in the world we proposed expanded national security and
international programs. ...
   Today, the American people can be proud of the progress that has
been made on each of these fronts. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The one area in which I have been persistently disappointed
throughout my term of office has been in the efforts to bring the
budget under control.
   Time and again I have proposed measures to help curb federal
domestic program spending. Time and again these proposals have been
rejected by Congress. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The fiscal year 1990 budget, my last, represents a continuation
of my efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit through restraint
in domestic spending.
   The budget I am submitting today complies with the deficit
targets set in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings (G-R-H) Act, by proposing
measures that meet the 1990 deficit target of $100 billion and
assure a steady reduction in the deficit leading to a balanced
budget in 1993. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   This budget shows that a gradual elimination of the deficit is
possible without raising taxes, without cutting into essential
social programs, without devastating defense, and without neglecting
other national priorities.
   It can be done in a reasonable, responsible way _ with discipline
and fairness.
   New taxes are not required. ...
   We have an opportunity this year to put the worst of the deficit
problem behind us and enable the next administration to begin its
term of office with a clean slate and with the promise of continuing
prosperity. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   To address urgent national priorities within the deficit limit
set by the G-R-H Act, my budget proposes that some programs _ such
as those for AIDS research and prevention, drug enforcement, and
technology development _ receive significant funding increases,
while others are reduced, reformed, or, in some cases, terminated.
...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Maintaining peace and protecting our country are the foremost
responsibilities of the federal government.
   Defense budget authority declined in real (inflation-adjusted)
terms for the fourth straight year with funding of $299 billion for
1989.
   This trend cannot continue without severe impact on combat
readiness.
   Therefore, my budget requests defense funding of $315 billion in
budget authority and $303 billion in outlays for 1990, and $331
billion in budget authority and $314 billion in outlays in 1991. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   This budget reflects my belief that addressing the problem of
AIDS must remain a top priority:
   _Preventing and alleviating suffering from the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, is our highest
public health priority. Federal support for research, prevention,
and treatment exceeds $2.1 billion in 1989, and will approach $2.8
billion in 1990. This budget asks for $1.6 billion, or 24 percent
over 1989, for Public Health Service HIV funding. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The program structure and incentives underlying many domestic
federal programs need to be altered to promote greater efficiency
and cost-effectiveness.
   _Current farm price support programs are far too costly.
   For the period 1986-89 an estimated $130 billion in federal
spending for farm-related assistance programs provided an average of
nearly $600,000 per farmer.
   Much of this assistance goes to farmers with high incomes _ more
than twice the U.S. family average.
   I therefore propose outlay reductions for the price and income
support programs of $2 billion in 1990 and additional annual
reductions of between $2 and $2.5 billion in each year from 1991
through 1994. ...
   _The rapidly rising costs of the Medicare program need to be
moderated.
   I propose a reasonable increase in the Medicare prospective
payment system rate and reductions in hospital capital payments and
special graduate medical education payments.
   Also, in an effort to restrain excessive growth in supplementary
medical insurance (SMI) costs, I propose extension of the current
law SMI premiums, limitations on physican payments, reductions in
payments for certain overpriced procedures, and reforms in the
durable medical equipment payment system.
   Medicare spending would still grow by 9 percent between 1989 and
1990 under these proposals _ but not by the 13 percent that would
occur under current law. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   As the federal government grew, it took on improper
responsibilities, and managed its programs inefficiently.
   We undertook to return the federal government to its proper role.
   We also initiated a major program to improve the management of
the remaining programs.
   These priorities are continued and expanded in this budget. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The persistence of the budget deficit is overwhelming evidence
that the federal budget process is fundamentally flawed.
   Past efforts at ``reform'' have been directed largely toward
protecting a large portion of domestic spending from real fiscal
discipline. ...
   Except for last year's on-time performance, Congress'
self-imposed budget deadlines have usually been missed, and massive
continuing resolutions and reconciliation bills have been the rule
rather than the exception.
   These large, cumbersome bills provide cozy hiding places for
hundreds of special interest add-ons, which line-item veto authority
would permit the president to challenge. ...
   _I remain committed to and urge approval of a constitutional
amendment requiring a balanced budget.
   The amendment should require a supermajority vote (at least 60
percent) in the Congress to increase taxes. ...
   _My successors should be given the authority, subject to
congressional override, to veto line-items in annual appropriations
bills, in authorizing legislation that provides or mandates funding
for programs, and in revenue bills.
   Such authority would permit the elimination of substantial waste
and would be an effective instrument for enforcing budget
discipline. ...
   _The annual budget process consumes too much time and energy.
   A biennial budget would reduce the repetitive budget tasks, allow
more time for considering key spending and revenue decisions,
provide less scope for gimmicks that give the illusion of
``savings,'' such as shifting spending from one year to another
without affecting the underlying programs, and permit the
realization of real savings that would be possible with a more
assured availability of funds. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The accomplishments of the American people in the past eight
years will always be for me a source of pride.
   However, we must continue our recent progress in reducing the
federal deficit.
   Deficit reduction is a key national priority, written into law by
the G-R-H Act, which, despite its defects, legislated a process to
achieve a balanced budget.
   This budget achieves the 1990 target of the amended act, and
projects a budget balance in 1993.
   It preserves legitimate programs for the aged and needy, provides
for adequate national security, devotes more resources to other
high-priority activities, and accomplishes all this without raising
taxes.
   Tax increases are not needed.
   History shows that they would simply be used by the Congress to
increase spending.
   Tax increases have been overwhelmingly voted down in the last
three presidential elections.
   I call upon the Congress to enact this budget.
   Higher taxes are not needed _ as this budget demonstrates _ but
genuine deficit reduction through moderating the growth in spending
is essential to enable the next administration and Congress to
address the nation's agenda for the future.

<HEAD>Reagan Would Block Tax Cut for Fliers, Make State Workers Pay for
Medicare</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   True to his word, President Reagan's final
budget calls for no general tax increase, although it would halt a
scheduled cut in aviation taxes and require all state and local
government workers to pay for Medicare.
   The budget that Reagan submitted to Congress on Monday includes a
$2.1 billion tax cut for corporations and $39 million of tax relief
for the oil and gas industries.
   Overall, revenues would drop by $1 billion, compared with current
law, under the budget for fiscal 1990, the 12 months that begin next
Oct. 1.
   Most of the revenue changes had been proposed a year ago; in
fact, the president has submitted some of them for several years
running, only to have them ignored or rejected by Congress.
   Reagan's written message cited his final budget as evidence
``that a gradual elimination of the deficit is possible without
raising taxes....''
   ``Tax increases are not needed,'' the president continued. ``Tax
increases have been overwhelmingly voted down in the last three
presidential elections.''
   However, among the hundreds of tables in the budget documents is
one showing that during Reagan's eight years in office, Congress
passed and he signed 13 separate tax increases that will cost
taxpayers $150 billion during the next budget year. Reagan-era tax
reductions will save taxpayers $377 billion next year.
   In addition to the tax changes he proposed for 1990, Reagan
recommended $1 billion of fees on those who use selected government
services. The largest single provision in this package, $394
million, would raise the 1 percent fee for VA loan guarantees to 3.8
percent and make it permanent.
   Another recommendation would require middle- and upper-income
veterans to pay a portion of the cost of government medical care for
non-service-connected problems.
   Commercial and recreational boaters would have to pay a $25
annual charge for using Coast Guard-patrolled waterways; entrance
fees would be imposed for Corps of Engineer recreational facilities;
charges at Forest Service facilities would be broadened, and the fee
on Commodity Credit Corp. loan guarantees would double, to 1.2
percent.
   Among the tax proposals:
   _Repeal a law requiring that taxes on airplane tickets (8
percent), air shippers (5 percent) and plane fuel be cut in half
next Jan. 1 unless federal spending for airports and airways reaches
a certain level. That level is not expected to be reached, but
Reagan called for keeping those taxes at current rates, which would
cost shippers and travelers $1.2 billion.
   _Require all state and local government workers to pay the tax
that funds Medicare; those hired before April 1, 1986, are not
paying, even though most are eligible for Medicare because of
earlier, non-government employment or through their spouses. This
would raise $2 billion.
   _Permit corporations that operate abroad to allocate at least
two-thirds of their total research costs to domestic income, saving
them $1.7 billion.
   _Make permanent a 20 percent tax credit for increased spending
for research, saving those businesses $400 milllion.
   _Liberalize deductions permitted oil and gas producers for
depletion, at a cost to the treasury of $39 million.
   _Increase Internal Revenue Service enforcement activities,
producing a $300 million boost in tax collections.
   Reagan again proposed to sell U.S. oilfields at Teapot Dome,
Wyo., and Elk Hills, Calif., for $1 billion, and all or parts of
several power-marketing administrations, including those in Alaska
and the Southeast, which would bring in $1.3 billion in 1990.
   The budget also proposes to raise money by selling or allowing
prepayment of $6.9 billion of government loans for $5.8 billion,
including those for college housing, and Small Business
Administration loans for business and disaster relief.

<HEAD>Dissident Tells Govt To Free Prisoner; Another Activist Released</HEAD>

   China's most prominent dissident on Monday called
for the release of the nation's most famous political prisoner. In
Shanghai, meanwhile, a pro-democracy activist was let out of jail.
   Fang Lizhi, an internationally respected astrophysicist, said
freeing all political prisoners, especially Wei Jingsheng, ``would
be a humanitarian gesture and would have a beneficial effect on our
social morale.''
   Fang made his call in a letter to Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping
that was obtained Monday.
   Wei, an electrician by profession, wrote a series of articles on
the need for democracy in 1978 during the ``Beijing Spring,'' a
period of relative political liberalization shortly after the end of
the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution. He was arrested on March 29,
1979, and sentenced to 15 years in prison for
``counterrevolutionary'' crimes.
   Amnesty Internatiomal, a London-based human rights group, has
adopted Wei as a prisoner of conscience. Human rights groups have
variously reported that Wei has died or is suffering from severe
schizophrenia in custody.
   Amnesty International estimates thousands of Chinese are in
prison for crimes of conscience.
   Fang was expelled from the Communist Party and fired from his
post as vice chairman of the Chinese Science and Technology
University in Hefei in 1987 for allegedly fomenting pro-democracy
unrest among the nation's students.
   He later was given a position as a high-level researcher at the
Chinese Academy of Sciences and allowed to travel abroad. China has
denied Fang's most recent request to go to the United States.
   In winter 1986-87, hundreds of thousands of students marched in
cities and called for democracy in China.
   Yang Wei, a former student at the University of Arizona, was one
of the demonstrators.
   On Monday, Yang was released from the Ti Lan Qiao Prison in
Shanghai after serving one year of a two-year sentence for
``counterrevolutionary'' activities.
   The Shanghai Foreign Affairs office said Yang was released Monday
because he had already spent about a year in custody before being
sentenced.
   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Yang said his
first concern was the health of his father, who has cancer.
   ``I'm going to see him today,'' said Yang. ``He is in the
hospital and he is in serious condition.''
   Yang said he did not regret marching for democracy and writing
for ``China Spring,'' the banned periodical of the Chinese Alliance
for Democracy, a U.S.-based dissident group. But he said he was
unclear whether he would continue working for political change in
China.
   Yang described his treatment in prison as ``pretty good.''
   ``It seemed that I was given special treatment,'' he said.
   Yang, 33, who received a masters degree in molecular biology from
Arizona, said he would like to return to the United States to
continue his studies.
   Sources close to the family said Yang's release was delayed by
several hours because three members of the Chinese Alliance for
Democracy were apprehended in Shanghai over the weekend with copies
of ``China Spring'' and a letter for Ywng.
   The alliance was set up in 1983 by a former Chinese citizen in
order to promote democracy in China. Chinese officials have declared
it an illegal organization.
   The men _ a Chinese-American, a Chinese-Canadian and a Chinese
citizen _ were put on flights out of China after they admitted
breaking the law, official reports said.
   It was not clear why the Chinese citizen, who is a student at
Utah State University, was allowed to leave.
   Yang was sentenced in December 1987. He had been held without
charges since January 1987 in the student protests.
   Prosecutors accused Yang of stirring up anti-government protests
in Shanghai. The court said he put up ``reactionary slogans'' at
Shanghai's Fudan University on Dec. 22, 1986, during student
demonstrations.
   On Dec. 3, 1987, the U.S. Congress called for Yang's release,
saying he had broken no Chinese or U.S. laws.
   China labeled the move ``an undisguised interference in China's
internal affairs.''
   Yang's wife, Che Shaoli, a medical student in the United States,
said she was thrilled at his release. ``But I am sad, too,'' she
said in a telephone interview from New York. ``I don't know when I
will see him.''

   The State Department said Monday a top Mexican
official newly appointed by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is
under indictment for alleged involvement in a car theft ring in
southern California.
   ``We believe that persons under indictment should face their
charges in court,'' department spokesman Charles Redman said.
   Redman did not name the official but published reports over the
weekend identified him as Miguel Nazar Haro, the chief of a newly
created intelligence unit in the Mexico City police department.
   The car theft ring was smashed in 1981 by the FBI and California
police.
   The Washington Post said in its Saturday editions that several
top antinarcotics and law enforcement officials appointed to
Salinas' six-week old government are suspected of having links to
major Mexican drug traffickers. The Post cited Mexican and foreign
sources.
   In response, Redman said, ``I would note ... that the Mexican
government does conduct a substantial anti-narcotics effort and
President Salinas has announced plans for new programs which, in his
words, are `to make life miserable,' as he has said, for the
traffickers.''

   About 1,500 workers at a coal mine near
Jastrzebie in southern Poland staged a successful two-hour work
stoppage Monday seeking improved working conditions, the banned
Solidarity trade union said.
   Miners at the Morcinek mine wanted a six-hour limit to the amount
of time miners can be forced to work in high temperatures, said
Wojciech Maziarski, a spokesman for the Solidarity Information
Service in Warsaw.
   They also asked for bonus pay for working under such conditions,
he said.
   Maziarski said management agreed to the demands after the
``warning strike,'' which lasted from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m., and several
hours of talks with workers' representatives from a Solidarity
committee at the mine and the official OPZZ trade union.
   There was no immediate information about the stoppage in the
official media, and a dispatcher at the mine refused comment when
reached by telephone.

<HEAD>New Law to Give Tax Breaks for Inventions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is trying to foster a
technological spurt with a proposal to offer tax breaks for
state-run enterprises that put new inventions to use, an official
said Monday.
   I.S. Nayashkov, chairman of the State Committee on Inventions and
Discoveries, told a news conference that a draft law on inventions
proposes giving a three-year income tax exemption to state-run
businesses that put inovations to use.
   Officials hope such a move will ``increase the interest of
enterprises in inventive work or in research and development,'' he
said. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev says more modern technology is
a key to modernizing Soviet industry and providing a higher standard
of living.
   The draft law was published in the official press Dec. 27, and
must be approved by the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, at one of its
sessions in 1989. It is unclear yet when it will go into effect.
   The law also would allow the establishment of venture banks to
encourage investors and set aside ``patent funds'' to help inventors
without the means to support their work, Nayashkov said.
   He said there has been ``little movement and weak dynamics'' in
recent years, with the number of applications for patents and the
number actually registered remaining virtually without change.
   Since 1983-84, Soviets have applied for between 170,000 and
190,000 patents annually and 70,000-80,000 have been granted, he
said. The remainder were judged not to offer anything substantially
new or valuable.
   Nayashkov said the law also seeks to better protect foreigners by
bringing Soviet patent law closer to a convention signed in
Washington in 1970, and gives Soviets the right to register their
inventions in foreign countries instead of the Soviet Union as long
as their inventions don't concern defense matters or state secrets.
