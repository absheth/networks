Mrs. Reagan was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award bythe Council of Fashion Designers of America at its eighth annualawards ceremony, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.   ``There are many pluses and minuses to being in the White House.One of the pluses is trying to help an industry that is one of themost important in our country and I think the American fashiondesigners are the best,'' said the first lady, who was wearing abrilliant red floor-length gown designed by Oscar de la Renta.   ``And when I found myself in the position to make others aware ofthat, or at least try to, I was delighted to do so,'' she added.   Broadcaster Barbara Walters, in presenting the award to Mrs.Reagan, said the first lady and the president, during his eightyears in office, ``gave us pride, gave us hope, gave us style ...that intriguing, all-encompassing word that says so much. Style.Presence. A sense of beauty. ... Nancy Reagan has style.''   Prior to the awards ceremony, de la Renta, president of thecouncil, said of Mrs. Reagan: ``I think she put American fashion onthe pedestal where it belongs and brought elegance back to Americanfashion.''   Designer Donna Karan said of Mrs. Reagan: ``The contribution tofashion she has made goes beyond her clothing to her sense ofsophistication, caring and elegance as first lady of the UnitedStates.''   Calvin Klein, accompanied by his wife Kelly, said: ``She hasshown how women can look so well-groomed, so attractive and soAmerican.''   Mrs. Reagan has been criticized for borrowing much of herhigh-priced wardrobe while living at the White House _ a practicecritics said amounted to free advertising for the designers whoseclothes she wore.   But Ms. Walters said she thought a first lady should be``encouraged to borrow'' because it ``stimulates American industry.''   Her comment caused the 500 ceremony guests to applaud vigorously.   Mrs. Reagan had worn the de la Renta gown she wore to theceremony on at least three other occasions, said Wendy Toler, aspokeswoman for the first lady.   Also among those recognized at the ceremony was designer Geoffrey
Received from server -->Beene, who was saluted for making ``fashion as art.''   Performer Liza Minelli, one of many women attending the ceremonywho dressed in Mrs. Reagan's favorite color, red, presented the
Received from server -->Perry Ellis award for new fashion talent to Isaac Mizrahi, whom shecalled ``a brilliant and startling talent.''
Received from server -->   Ms. Minelli wore a floor-length gown with a leg-revealing slitdesigned by Mizrahi.   Actress Audrey Hepburn, wearing a red gown designed by Givenchy,

Received from server --><TEXT>   An Agriculture Department analyst says the 1986tax reforms can mean substantial savings to farmers when incomesrise but that the old federal rules allowed bigger breaks as
Received from server -->earnings decline.
Received from server -->   Clifford V. Rossi of the department's Economic Research Servicesaid the Tax Reform Act of 1986 can reduce overall tax liability for
Received from server -->farmers by an average of 4.5 percent from previous levels.   Rossi used a computer model and information from more than 15,000federal tax returns of ``farm sole proprietorships'' for 1982 tocome up with the estimates. His findings were in a new staff report
Received from server -->circulated by the agency.   Farm sole proprietorships were defined as ``self-employedindividuals filing a Schedule F federal tax form,'' which is thebasic paperwork required of farmers by the Internal Revenue Service.   ``In general, lower marginal tax rates and generous expensingprovisions will offset repeal of the investment tax credit and
Received from server -->capital gains preference,'' the report said. ``Taxpayers with highoff-farm incomes receive little benefit from the new law.''   Rossi noted that farm incomes can vary greatly because of
Received from server -->weather, economic conditions and other factors. So he performed a``sensitivity analysis'' that includes a 25 percent increase and
Received from server -->another that includes a 25 percent decrease on farm income.   The increase in net farm income resulted in a 10.9 percent
Received from server -->increase in federal tax liability under the old rules and only an8.3 percent increase under the 1985 law, he said.
Received from server -->   By contrast, Rossi showed that a 25 percent drop in income wouldresult in a decline of 8.7 percent in taxes under the old federal
Received from server -->system and only 7.7 percent less under the new reforms.
Received from server -->   ``In terms of net winners and losers from tax reform, taxpayers
Received from server -->engaged in field crop and general livestock operations benefit morefrom the new tax laws than other farm groups,'' he said. ``All
Received from server -->sectors, with the exception of the dairy sector, experience netreductions in tax liabilities under tax reform.''
Received from server -->   Rossi said dairy farmers suffer under the new tax law ``becauseof low taxable incomes that consequently cannot offset the loss of
Received from server -->capital gains preference'' and investment tax credit, two of themajor writeoffs under the old law.
Received from server -->   ``Farm enterprises with relatively high capital intensities areburdened more by the loss of certain preferences for capital
Received from server -->intensities than other farm operations,'' he said. ``There is also
Received from server -->some evidence that more generous expensing and depreciation
Received from server -->provisions are of greater consequence to capital-intensiveoperations than other farm types.''
Received from server -->   Rossi said the 1986 law ``tends to reduce tax burdens fortaxpayers with low and moderate levels of income'' and that those
Received from server -->whose taxable incomes were more than $500,000 showed the smallestdecline in taxes.
Received from server -->   According to Rossi, the new study is ``the only comprehensiveassessment of tax liability in the agricultural sector'' and will
Received from server -->aid in future policy considerations.   ``If history is any indicator of future activity in tax policy,
Received from server -->the Tax Reform Act of 1986 will undergo refinement or overhaul inthe years ahead with accompanying effects on agriculture,'' he said.

Received from server -->   One of every three men and women walking downthe aisle in the United States has been married before, but theremarriage rate for divorced Americans has been declining, according
Received from server -->to a National Center for Health Statistics report.   The government report also shows that most divorced men marrydivorced women and that of those divorced Americans remarrying in
Received from server -->1983, the women were on the average 34 years old and the men, an
Received from server -->average 37 years old.   The report is based on samples of records from states thatcompile marriage and divorce statistics. It studies data collectedfrom 1970 to 1983, the latest year for which most of the figures
Received from server -->were available.
Received from server -->   The number of remarriages increased during the period studied,rising from 404,000 in 1970 to 736,000 in 1983 for divorced womenand from 423,000 to 773,000 over the 14-year period for divorced men.
Received from server -->   But although the number of remarriages was growing over those
Received from server -->years, the pool of divorced men and women was growing faster, the
Received from server -->report said.   In 1983, the remarriage rate for divorced women was 91.6 per
Received from server -->1,000 compared with 123.3 per 1,000 in 1970. The rate for divorcedmen was 142.1 per 1,000 compared with 204.5 per 1,000 in 1970, the
Received from server -->report said.
Received from server -->   ``Thus, only 9 percent of divorced women and 14 percent ofdivorced men remarried in 1983, compared with 12 percent of divorced
Received from server -->women and 20 percent of divorced men in 1970,'' the report said.   The figures also show that most women marry men of the samemarital status. In 1983, the report said, 55 percent of all women
Received from server -->and men who married were both single, 19 percent were both divorced
Received from server -->and 2 percent were both widowed.   Men traditionally are older than the women they marry, and thisgenerally holds true for remarriages as well as first marriages,
Received from server -->according to the study. The only combinations in which that trend isbroken is for divorced and widowed women who marry single men. In
Received from server -->1983, widowed women were an average 2 years older and divorced women
Received from server -->were an average 1 year older than the single men they married.   Many of the patterns for first marriages don't hold up for secondand subsequent marriages, the report noted.
Received from server -->   While more than three-quarters of first marriages are performedin religious settings, the proportion drops to about 60 percent for
Received from server -->marriages involving divorced men and women.   Also, first marriages have a typical seasonal pattern _ many more
Received from server -->are performed in the summer than in the winter, the report said. Butsecond and subsequent marriages tend to be spread more evenly

Received from server -->   Fear that the U.S. government will go it alonein world trade is discouraging other countries from joining in an
Received from server -->accord that could cut spending on farmers by tens of billions ofdollars every year, according to a report published by the
Received from server -->International Monetary Fund.   Fund experts see a possibility that James M. Baker III,
Received from server -->designated as secretary of state by President-elect Bush, will
Received from server -->single out favored countries as trading partners instead of
Received from server -->promoting U.S. trade with the whole world.   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, whose
Received from server -->members include the governments of the major industrial countries,says farm subsidies cost consumers and taxpayers $185 billion a year
Received from server -->between 1984 and 1986. The biggest costs are in the United States,western Europe and Japan.   The IMF report cites a speech last year by Baker, then secretary
Received from server -->of the treasury. Baker spoke of what the U.S. government would do ifthere were a failure of the trade talks now being held by
Received from server -->representatives of 96 countries.   ``We might be willing to explore a `market liberalization club'approach, through mini-lateral arrangements or a series of bilateral
Received from server -->agreements,'' Bush was quoted as saying.   Bilateral agreements are like the new one between the United
Received from server -->States and Canada, freeing up trade between two countries buttending to freeze out others. A similar deal with Israel was madeearlier last year. A ``mini-lateral'' arrangement includes not just
Received from server -->two but a group of countries, like the 12 in the European EconomicCommunity.   Groups of this kind encourage trade among members at the expense
Received from server -->of those outside the club.   The report was written before last month's meeting in Montreal of
Received from server -->representatives from the 96 governments. They agreed on how tonegotiate 11 different kinds of trade issues in the remaining two
Received from server -->years of talks. But they failed to agree on four others, includingagriculture.
Received from server -->   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter insisted that othergovernments, especially the Europeans, promise to join in a
Received from server -->long-term phase-out of subsidies before he would talk about cuttingthem in the immediate future. Bush has picked Yeutter as his
Received from server -->secretary of agriculture.   On Thursday Alan Holmer, Yeutter's deputy as trade
Received from server -->representative, said he was optimistic about agreement being reached
Received from server -->on farm issues by April, a new deadline set at Montreal. But
Received from server -->negotiations are being soured by a fight between the Europeancommunity and the Reagan administration over the hormones that U.S.
Received from server -->farmers use to make their cattle grow faster.   Last Sunday the community, which tries to keep its own farmers
Received from server -->from using hormones, banned imports of U.S. beef and veal worth over$100 million a year. The Reagan administration retaliated with
Received from server -->increases of 100 percent in import duties on such items as Danishhams and sun-dried tomatoes from Italy, a measure designed to make
Received from server -->them too expensive for Americans to want to buy. The Europeans arethreatening a counter-reprisal and U.S. officials say they have a
Received from server -->list ready should that happen.
Received from server -->   A truce is in effect at least until Jan. 23, when ministers offoreign affairs from the 12 countries are due to meet in Brussels.
Received from server -->Bush will have been inaugurated three days earlier and the newadministration may have some ideas for getting the talks back on the
Received from server -->rails. Yeutter is to be replaced as trade representative by CarlaHills.
Received from server -->   The report published by the International Monetary Fund is called
Received from server -->``Issues and Developments in International Trade Policy.'' It was
Received from server -->written by a team under Margaret Kelly, an Australian who heads thefund's Trade and Payments Division.
Received from server -->   The fund is owned by 151 countries, with the United Statesholding the biggest block of votes.

Received from server --><TEXT>   General Douglas MacArthur and others directing
Received from server -->the occupation of Japan after World War II resisted powerful U.S.and allied opposition in keeping the late Emperor Hirohito on the
Received from server -->chrysanthemum throne, where he reigned for another 43 years.
Received from server -->   The emperor's prosecution for war crimes, execution, imprisonmentor exile was favored by 70 percent of Americans in a public opinion
Received from server -->poll seven weeks before the end of the war. Some allied governments
Received from server -->had similar views.   MacArthur, supreme commander of the U.S. occupation of Japan, was
Received from server -->the best known of those resisting demands for punishing the monarchwho died in Tokyo Saturday at the age of 87 after a 62-year reign
Received from server -->marked by military expansion, crushing defeat, reconciliation,dramatic economic growth and new heights of prosperity and prestige
Received from server -->for his country.   Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and six other Japanese officials were
Received from server -->convicted and hanged as a result of the Tokyo war crimes trials.Tojo's testimony at one point threatened to implicate the emperor in
Received from server -->whose name the militarists had overrun East Asia.   Documents released in Washington 25 years ago by the State
Received from server -->Department show that MacArthur and other U.S. officials decidedretention of Hirohito was vital to maintaining order in the former
Received from server -->enemy country and carrying out their mission of democratic reform.
Received from server -->   But those planning Japan's future were also aware that the
Received from server -->emotions of war had generated powerful sentiment in America andother allied countries for prosecuting and ousting the mikado asresponsible for aggression and atrocities of the imperial military
Received from server -->command, the documents showed.   George Gallup, director of the American Institute of Public
Received from server -->Opinion, declared June 23, 1945, that ``the average American''thinks Hirohito ``should be treated like any other war criminal.''
Received from server -->   In his latest Gallup poll, he said, 33 percent of thosequestioned said Hirohito should be executed, 17 percent said ``let
Received from server -->the court decide his fate,'' 11 percent said ``keep him in prisonthe rest of his life'' and 9 percent wanted to exile him. Only 4
Received from server -->percent favored ignoring him as a mere figurehead, 3 percent said``use him as a puppet to run Japan.'' Other replies or no opinion
Received from server -->accounted for 23 percent.   MacArthur wrote in his memoirs that Hirohito had already been
Received from server -->stricken from the list of potential war crimes defendants when themonarch first visited him Sept. 30, 1945. Hands trembling, the
Received from server -->emperor offered to bear sole responsibility for the war, MacArthur
Received from server -->wrote, adding that, ``I knew I faced the First Gentleman of Japan inhis Own Right.''
Received from server -->   Four months later, the five-star general messaged Washington thatHirohito's indictment and execution could trigger a convulsion,
Received from server -->potential chaos and guerrilla warfare in Japan. One millionoccupation troops might be needed and ``all hope of introducing
Received from server -->democratic methods would disappear,'' MacArthur said.   George Atcheson Jr., MacArthur's State Department adviser, told
Received from server -->Truman in 1946: ``There is no question that the emperor is mostuseful. He is obeyed ... he manifests sincerity in wishing to aid in
Received from server -->the accomplishment of our general objectives and is seemingly moreanxious to be democratic than some of the people around him.''
Received from server -->   A specialist strongly advocating retention of the emperor wasHugh Borton, member of the U.S. State-War-Navy coordinating
Received from server -->committee in Washington that began studies before the end of the waron occupation policy and sent its findings to MacArthur.
Received from server -->   Reached at his home in Conway, Mass., Borton, now 83, said thecommittee favored keeping Hirohito on the basis of expert opinion
Received from server -->that ``he was one who could more influence the Japanese populace
Received from server -->than anyone else, and the important thing for the United States was
Received from server -->to make the occupation as effective as possible rather than acontinuation of the war.''
Received from server -->   First indications, in August 1945, that the emperor might beretained produced a strong but mixed reaction in Congress. Sen. Tom
Received from server -->Stewart D-Tenn., said the emperor is ``a war criminal and I'd liketo see him hung up by his toes.''
Received from server -->   Sen. William Langer, R-N.D., said the emperor ``ought to betreated like Hitler.''
Received from server -->   Sen. Richard Russell, D-Ga., who later introduced an unsuccessfulresolution urging trial of the emperor, called anything less than
Received from server -->unconditional surrender ``a terrible mistake.''   But Sens. Styles Bridges, R-N.H., Elbert Thomas, D-Utah, and
Received from server -->Robert Taft, R-Ohio, said it should be possible to deal sternly and
Received from server -->effectively with Japan and simplify military operations by workingthrough the emperor.

Received from server --><TEXT>   President Reagan's submission today of his
Received from server -->$1.15 trillion federal budget for fiscal 1990 triggers a workschedule that is specified by law, cited with reverence by lawmakers
Received from server -->and then routinely ignored.   This year should be no different.
Received from server -->   The law calls for Congress to have completed work on the spendingplan by April 15. In addition, all 13 appropriations bills thatfinance the federal government are supposed to be in place by the
Received from server -->Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year.   But that rarely happens, and ingredients for delay abound this
Received from server -->year.   Congress will be treating Reagan's proposal as largely
Received from server -->inconsequential and waiting for a new plan from President-elect Bushafter his inauguration. The House Budget Committee isn't even
Received from server -->planning any hearings on Reagan's blueprint and will wait insteaduntil it receives something from Bush.
Received from server -->   In addition, Bush's repeated pledges to avoid new taxes puts himin direct conflict with many congressional leaders who say the
Received from server -->additional revenues will be unavoidable.
Received from server -->   ``There probably hasn't been a year in the last five where thelikelihood of keeping to the budget schedule is less likely,'' says
Received from server -->Stanley E. Collender, the Washington-based director of federal
Received from server -->budget policy for the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse.   This hasn't stopped top members of Congress from their usualpledges to move quickly on the budget.
Received from server -->   Last Monday, Congress' first day in session, House Speaker JimWright, D-Texas, set a goal of meeting budget deadlines and said,
Received from server -->``So far as the speaker can influence the schedule, we shall performour work on time.''
Received from server -->   And new Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn.,
Received from server -->expressed the same desire in a telephone interview last week, adding
Received from server -->that the delay caused by the presidential transition ``doesn't waivethe provisions of the law'' setting the budget work schedule.
Received from server -->   But history shows that fiscal and political crises, nottimetables, govern the budget process.
Received from server -->   Budget deadlines set by law come and go with no real consequencesif they are missed.
Received from server -->   But three key fiscal events are scheduled to occur roughlysimultaneously this fall and are likely to spur action in what
Received from server -->Collender, borrowing from the language of New Age adherents, calls``the political equivalent of the harmonic convergence.''
Received from server -->   Sometime this August or September, the government is expected toreach its debt ceiling of $2.8 trillion, meaning that legislation
Received from server -->will be needed for it to be able to borrow more money.   At the same time, if there is no budget agreement between
Received from server -->Congress and the White House, the mechanism will begin thatultimately triggers the dreaded automatic spending slashes required
Received from server -->under the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. Those cuts _ which are
Received from server -->seen by most people as draconian _ would take effect Oct. 1.   In addition, September is the last month of the fiscal year. Some
Received from server -->sort of legislation that provides money must be in place by Oct. 1or the government cannot function.
Received from server -->   Stalemates are common when it comes to the budget because theblueprint is the most basic statement of the government's
Received from server -->priorities. It not only perpetually creates institutional strugglesbetween the executive and legislative branches, but it is a
Received from server -->battleground for Democrats and Republicans positioning themselvesfor future elections.
Received from server -->   Last year was unusual for its budget harmony because most of thecrucial decisions were made at a summit among Reagan administration
Received from server -->officials and congressional leaders shortly after the October 1987stock market crash. It was the first year in 12 in which all 13
Received from server -->spending bills were finished by Oct. 1.   In 1987, spending legislation was not completed until nearly
Received from server -->Christmas, three months into the fiscal year.</TEXT>

Received from server --><DATELINE>CLYDE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
Received from server --><TEXT>   The city manager is on the verge of flipping a
Received from server -->switch that will send electricity flowing through city-owned power
Received from server -->lines, a change he says will save money for residents of this
Received from server -->northern Ohio town.   But officials for the Toledo Edison Co., which now supplieselectricity to the town's 5,600 residents, say a municipal powersystem will be unreliable and electric rates will eventually
Received from server -->increase and surpass their rates.   City Manager Nelson Summit admits that the Clyde Light and Power
Received from server -->Co. is a gamble.   ``What it boiled down to was I felt there was a better way toprovide electricity. It turned out that it is going to be cheaper
Received from server -->and rates will get a lot better in the future,'' Summit said in arecent interview.   But Toledo Edison is putting up a fight.
Received from server -->   It filed a lawsuit last month after the city refused to startnegotiating the renewal of the private company's franchise to servethe city. The contract expires in June 1990.   Toledo Edison wants to force Clyde to explain to the state Public
Received from server -->Utilities Commission why the company should not be allowed to
Received from server -->compete with the new municipal system in Clyde, about 30 miles
Received from server -->southeast of Toledo.   Toledo Edison will lose about $7 million to $8 million annuallyin revenues if the franchise is not renewed, said Mark Everhart,
Received from server -->general manager of the utility's eastern district.   The utility has 275,000 customers in northwestern Ohio. ``LosingClyde is kind of like cutting the heart out of a distributionsystem,'' he said.
Received from server -->   The conversion to a city-owned system had its beginnings fiveyears ago when Summit moved to Clyde and saw his electric bills
Received from server -->double.
Received from server -->   Voters in November 1987 approved a $10 million bond issue to setup the utility company. Early last year, the city agreed to buypower wholesale from the Canton-based Ohio Power Co. at 3.1 centsper kilowatt hour.   The city wanted to buy Toledo Edison's distribution system, butthe company's selling price of $30 million was too high, Summit said.   Now, Clyde is building a new substation, distribution andtransmission lines. Its first customer, a Whirlpool Corp. plant, is
Received from server -->expected to be on line in early March, Summit said.
Received from server -->   The City Council recently set rates for the new system at 7 centsper kilowatt hour. The current rate is 9.5 cents and the average
Received from server -->household pays $52 a month. That's expected to drop to $39.
Received from server -->   More than 80 Ohio communities have municipal electric systems,
Received from server -->most buying power wholesale from utilities, but no municipal systemhas been set up since the early 1900s.   Clyde's operation is being closely watched by other Ohiomunicipalities interested in cutting electric rates.
Received from server -->   ``There is no doubt about it, a precedent has already been setand Toledo Edison is worried,'' Summit said.
Received from server -->   But there are several inherent problems with municipal power
Received from server -->systems, Everhart said. In coming years, some cities may have
Received from server -->trouble buying power wholesale because supplies will diminish, theutility company official said.   ``A no-frill utility company will work fine until the wind blowshard, until there is a major accident and until something goes
Received from server -->wrong. And then all of a sudden, you are left holding the bag,''said Everhart.

Received from server --><DATELINE>KEGWORTH, England (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Belfast-bound jetliner carrying 126
Received from server -->people crashed beside a highway in central England on Sunday and
Received from server -->broke into pieces, killing at least 37 people and injuring 76,officials said.   The airline said the crash was caused by engine failure and ruledout sabotage.   The British Midland Airways Boeing 737-400 was en route from
Received from server -->London's Heathrow Airport to Northern Ireland when it developed
Received from server -->engine trouble, the Civil Aviation Authority said.   The jet attempted to land at East Midlands Airport near
Received from server -->Nottingham, about 100 miles north of London, but undershot therunway by a half-mile and crashed alongside a highway, smashed into
Received from server -->an embankment and broke apart, police said.   Witnesses reported seeing an engine in flames as the aircraftcame in low, dropping bits of debris and shearing off treetops as it
Received from server -->careened toward the highway. Cars swerved to avoid the hulk and
Received from server -->there were a few minor injuries from auto collisions, police said.   ``We believe that 37 people have died as a result of thisaccident, but there are still some people in the wreckage,''Leicestershire Assistant Chief Constable Tony Butler told a news
Received from server -->conference.   He said he did not know whether the trapped people were dead oralive. It was also not certain that all 37 were aboard the plane,since police reported there may have been casualties in cars on thehighway.
Received from server -->   After nearly eight hours of rescue efforts at the edge ofEngland's busiest north-south highway, one of the people aboard was
Received from server -->still trapped alive in the wreckage and two bodies awaited recovery,
Received from server -->the Leicestershire Ambulance Service said.   Police in the county of Derbyshire reported several bodiesscattered on each side of the highway. Two nearby hospitals reporteda total of 76 people injured.   ``All of them seemed to have smashed ankles and legs, and with a
Received from server -->lot, their faces were badly damaged too,'' said Joe Weston-Webb, 50,
Received from server -->who lives in the nearby village of Sutton Bonningale and was amongthe first on the scene. He helped rescue several people and saw many
Received from server -->bodies in the wreckage.   ``It seems a miracle that any one got out alive though, and Ican't believe that it all didn't go up in flames. It was
Received from server -->horrendous.''
Received from server -->   The plane, a new aircraft that only had been in service for three
Received from server -->months, was carrying 118 passengers and eight crew, the airline said.   The crash was the second major air tragedy in Britain in threeweeks. On Dec. 21, a Pan Am Boeing 747 bound for New York blew up
Received from server -->over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on
Received from server -->the ground. That jet had also left Heathrow. A bomb was blamed forthe crash.   The flight Sunday took off from Heathrow Airport at 7:52 p.m. andits engine caught fire 10 minutes later, the Department of Transportsaid.
Received from server -->   The pilot told the control tower he had the engine fire under
Received from server -->control, but when the plane was still one to two miles out, ``it wasclear that there would be an accident,'' airport official MichaelCowan told a news conference.   `As the plane approached the control tower it was apparent it wastoo low,'' he said.   Airline executive Colin Roberts told relatives at Belfast
Received from server -->Airport, ``There was absolutely no question of sabotage and therewas nothing to indicate that whatsoever.''
Received from server -->   The accident was caused by a technical fault in one of theengines of the new plane, which had made seven flights on the
Received from server -->London-Belfast route, he said. The weather was reported good.   The 737 crashed at about 8:30 p.m. (3:30 p.m. EST) about a mileoutside the village of Kegworth, Inspector Neville Cotterill of the
Received from server -->Leicestershire police said.   The tail section as embedded in the ground and the fuselage broke
Received from server -->into several parts spread over fields, Cotterill told The Associated
Received from server -->Press.   But he added that no cars were known to have been hit as the
Received from server -->plane thundered alongside the M1, England's main north-south highway.   The highway was closed as dozens of ambulances and fire engines
Received from server -->converged on the scene. Cries for help could be heard from insidethe fuselage. Personal belongings littered the highway.
Received from server -->   Rescuers dug steps into the embankment and formed a human chainfrom the wreckage to the ambulances. They flattened trees and hacked
Received from server -->open the fuselage.
Received from server -->   The cockpit with a large chunk of fuselage came to rest in thickbrambles and trees near the top of the embankment.
Received from server -->   The pilot, Capt. Kevin Hunt, was hospitalized with multipleinjuries, British Midland said.   A local vicar, the Rev. Michael Brandon, said he held apassenger's hand and whispered the Lord's Prayer to him as he died.   ``It was very dignified and peaceful. There is not a lot more you
Received from server -->can do in a situation like this,'' he said.   The crippled jet roared over 16-year-old Samantha Phelby's house
Received from server -->just before it hit the ground.
Received from server -->   ``We looked outside as it got louder and as it was going overheadwe saw the left engine still on fire. Then we heard this pop, whichcould have been the crash. Then we heard the fire engines,'' she
Received from server -->told Independent Radio News.
Received from server -->   Desmond Anderson, who lives 400 yards from the airport's mainrunway, said, `The far side engine was on fire, backfiring androaring away ...   An Automobile Association manager, John McKnight, said: ``Thereare still people trapped and work is going on to free them. From the
Received from server -->reports I have had there is a terrific amount of wreckage. It's ahell of a mess.''
Received from server -->   British Midland chairman Michael Bishop said said the pilot
Received from server -->reported ``severe vibrations in one of the engines'' and askedclearance for an emergency landing at the airport.   Bishop said the company had taken delivery of the plane only 12weeks ago.   Civil Aviation Authority spokeswoman Ann Noonan said the pilot
Received from server -->reported problems in his No. 2 engine and was having trouble
Received from server -->climbing. The two-engined aircraft disappeared off ground control
Received from server -->radar screens at 8:15 p.m.   The Boeing 737-400 is a version of the Boeing 737 with a longer
Received from server -->fuselage and can carry 146 passengers. It was introduced last year.</TEXT>

Received from server --><TEXT>   Political parties are struggling to emerge inthis British colony but face the formidable hurdles of apathy,public distrust and a wary Communist China, which gains sovereigntyover the territory in 1997.   Attempts to form the groups comes as Britain prepares to holdHong Kong's first general legislative elections and China appears to
Received from server -->have reluctantly dropped its opposition to such activity.   The organizations will be different from Western-style political
Received from server -->parties because they will not be able to form a sovereigngovernment. Instead, they will be limited to trying to influence the
Received from server -->outgoing British rulers and pursuing whatever local power Beijing
Received from server -->permits under the ``high degree of autonomy'' it promises for thiscapitalist enclave after 1997.
Received from server -->   ``The administration of Hong Kong will be in the hands of HongKong people, so in that sense we still have a lot of power,'' said
Received from server -->Yeung Sum, chairman of Meeting Point, a pressure group of about 300members that views itself as a future party.
Received from server -->   In recent weeks, businessman Stephen Cheong and lawyer Martin
Received from server -->Lee, both members of the colony's Legislative Council, haveannounced plans to form political parties. Councilor Maria Tam's
Received from server -->Progressive Hong Kong Society also is mentioned as an emerging party.   Those groups are expected to participate in general elections to
Received from server -->be held in 1991 for 10 of 56 seats on the council, which isprimarily a forum to debate policy made by the British governor and
Received from server -->his advisers. The council now consists of government officials,government appointees and representatives of interest groups and
Received from server -->local advisory boards.   The 1991 elections ``will be run on party lines, I'm quitesure,'' said Joseph Y.S. Cheng, a political scientist at the Chinese
Received from server -->University of Hong Kong. But the groups will face huge problems in
Received from server -->gathering support from Hong Kong's 5.7 million people, whotraditionally distrust political parties.   Families who fled to the coastal enclave blame China's myriad
Received from server -->20th century woes on both the Communists and Nationalists, who moved
Received from server -->to Taiwan after the 1949 revolution. Both parties operateunofficially in Hong Kong.
Received from server -->   ``People in Hong Kong feel very comfortable with the status quo,
Received from server -->and they are afraid of political activities, politicalconfrontation,'' Cheng said.   Yeung acknowledged that Meeting Point had not clearly declareditself a political party for so long because ``all through the
Received from server -->years, people (have been) skeptical of the label.'' Cheong rejectsthe ``party'' label for his new group.   Political scientist Peter Harris of the University of Hong Kong
Received from server -->believes the groups will have trouble winning broad backing. He said``the mass of the Hong Kong people are more interested ... in
Received from server -->getting the kids to school. Their understanding of issues is stillin a very inchoate stage.''
Received from server -->   Attempts by civic leaders three years ago to form political
Received from server -->parties stalled not from apathy but because of China's opposition,
Received from server -->according to Lee.   That stance appears to have softened, however, with the onset oflegislative elections that China has promised will continue after1997.   Xu Jiatun, China's main representative in Hong Kong, said earlythis month that the new constitution being drafted for the territory
Received from server -->effectively allows political parties.
Received from server -->   Many of the emerging political groups have not clearly stated anideology and may be identified primarily by the personality of theirleaders. Some of those leaders may seek to become Hong Kong's firstchief executive, which will be the top local post after the Britishleave.   Cheong said his group will call for stability and only gradual
Received from server -->political change, while Lee is the territory's most vocal advocate
Received from server -->of sweeping democratic reform. Three-year-old Meeting Point's goalsinclude a high degree of self administration for the territory after1997, a central social security fund and more education subsidies,Yeung said.
Received from server -->   Lee believes the major issue dividing the parties will be whether
Received from server -->they speak primarily for Beijing or Hong Kong interests.   One big question is whether the Chinese Communist Party in Hong
Received from server -->Kong, which now works behind the scenes, will go above ground toopenly participate in elections.
Received from server -->   ``That would frighten the industrialists away, immediately,''said Lee.
Received from server -->   Despite the growing activity of local political groups, Harrissees little hope for them to wield real power, noting thatauthoritarian Communist countries such as China do not acceptchallenges to their rule.</TEXT></DOC>

Received from server -->domination. John Crocker, whose ancestors were among the town'sfirst 45 inhabitants, puts it in physical terms: ``In the CrockerTavern (still standing) there is a gouge out of one of the beams
Received from server -->where a couple of fellows had a sword fight over the issue.''
Received from server -->   The town neither endorsed nor opposed the Declaration of
Received from server -->Independence. A town meeting initially voted against the U.S.Constitution because it lacked a bill of rights.   ``The people were more wealthy down here and they were tendingtoward the status quo,'' said Robert O'Leary, a social studies
Received from server -->teacher.   Early thriving industries included cranberry harvesting, which
Received from server -->survives to this day, shipbuilding, lumbering, oystering andextraction of salt from the ocean. Today tourism dominates.   Because of the importance of sea trade to Barnstable, the
Received from server -->townspeople opposed the War of 1812 against Britain. This time there
Received from server -->was no give to their position: Isaiah L. Green, the area's U.S.
Received from server -->representative, voted for the declaration of war and lost his seat,according to the school department history.   Residents remember the Kennedy era fondly. They speak of John F.Kennedy parading through town after his Democratic presidentialnomination, and of his victory speech in Hyannis after the 1960
Received from server -->election.   But at the polls, residents favored Richard Nixon by 4,515 to
Received from server -->2,783. They had no greater favorite-son feelings last year, when
Received from server -->George Bush beat Dukakis 10,026 to 9,971.
Received from server -->   Joseph Kennedy brought his family to Hyannisport in 1926 but itwasn't until his son became a national figure that the sandy beachesand sunshine of Cape Cod gained national attention and later
Received from server -->unrestrained development, say local historians.   ``The beauty, uniqueness and excitement of the cape portrayed bythe press put Barnstable on the map and in the world spotlight,''
Received from server -->according to the school department narrative.   Cape Codders regret some of the growth, as they showed last fall
Received from server -->when they supported a non-binding resolution in favor of a buildingmoratorium. Former U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas, a Cape Cod summerresident, said the problems on Cape Cod are as much aesthetic asenvironmental.   ``Much of what has been built on Route 28 in Hyannis is
Received from server -->schlock,'' Tsongas said. ``If the development that took place was
Received from server -->architecturally consistent with the cape, it would not have been
Received from server -->half as offensive as it is.''</TEXT></DOC><DOC><DOCNO> AP890109-0016 </DOCNO>

Received from server --><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>
Received from server -->   The number of students entering nursing schooljumped 11 percent last year because of higher salaries and a healthy
Received from server -->job market, according to the magazine that surveyed more than 220
Received from server -->schools.   The increase follows a nearly a one-third drop from 1983 to 1987.   Schools responding to the annual survey, to be published today bythe trade magazine Nursingworld Journal, had a total of 15,494freshmen in 1988, up from 13,970 in 1987.   ``Probably the most important thing is that there has been so
Received from server -->much publicity about the national shortage of nurses,'' PublisherRichard A. DeVito, said Friday.   But a more troubling factor, DeVito said, is that many schools
Received from server -->have reduced entry level grade point averages to attract more
Received from server -->applicants. Perhaps as a result, he said, graduate nurses failed
Received from server -->their licensing exams at a record rate of 16 percent in 1988, fourtimes the 1987 level.
Received from server -->   The journal said it sent its survey to 1,491 U.S. nursing schools
Received from server -->and received responses from 227 institutions in 44 states.   Hospital officials hailed the finding as good news for thenation's health care system, which has been strained by a``significant and persistent shortage'' of nurses, according to aDecember report by the Commission on Nursing of the U.S. Department
Received from server -->of Health and Human Services.   About 300,000 nursing jobs were unfilled nationwide, the AmericanNurses Association estimated last year.
Received from server -->   DeVito said the shortage has had a direct impact on wages,pushing up starting salaries for registered nurses by an average of
Received from server -->$5,000 to $6,000 during the last five years. Registered nurses nowtypically start at $22,000 to $28,000 a year, depending on region,
Received from server -->and experienced nurses earn up to $55,000 in some cities, he said.
Received from server -->   According to the survey, licensed practical nursing programsexperienced the greatest increase in beginning students in 1988,with a 25.4 percent jump. Hospital-based diploma programs were next,
Received from server -->with a 14.6 percent rise.   Baccalaureate programs at four-year colleges and universities saw
Received from server -->a 10.7 percent increase. The smallest change was in associate degree
Received from server -->programs offered by two-year junior colleges, which reported 8.7
Received from server -->percent more freshmen.
Received from server -->   DeVito cautioned that because of the decline in entrance
Received from server -->requirements, the overall increase of 11 percent may not necessarilytranslate into an 11 percent rise in the number of graduates.   ``The problem it's going to create is that while we have roughly
Received from server -->a big increase in freshman enrollees, they've lowered the admissionstandards, so we may have fewer people who are going to be able tomake the grade,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC><DOC><DOCNO> AP890109-0017 </DOCNO><FILEID>AP-NR-01-09-89 0124EST</FILEID>

Received from server -->intelligence community.''
Received from server -->   Thornburgh's comments on ABC-TV's ``This Week With DavidBrinkley'' came after questions of whether he realized hisadministration's decision to withhold some classified evidence onnational security grounds would force the prosecutor to drop some
Received from server -->charges against the fired National Security Council aide.
Received from server -->   The attorney general said he himself was concerned about anyimpression ``there was some kind of cover-up or stonewalling of theindependent counsel's office.''   In a meeting Wednesday, the day before Walsh moved to drop thecharges, Thornburgh said he asked for Walsh's personal assurance

Received from server -->   Walsh ``had no hesitation in satisfying my concerns on that

Received from server --><TEXT>   Americans generally agree that homelessness iswidespread and worsening, and most are dissatisfied with thegovernment's response and would be willing to pay more taxes tocombat the problem, a poll has found.
Received from server -->   A plurality of the 1,084 adults surveyed in the Media
Received from server -->General-Associated Press poll primarily faulted society rather than
Received from server -->the homeless for homelessness.   A plurality also said the federal government is chieflyresponsible for solutions.   The poll exhibited the broad reach of homelessness: Six in 10said homeless people were in their communities, and three-quarterssaid the problem plagues communities of all sizes, not just big
Received from server -->cities.   Accordingly, respondents rated the problem as extraordinarily
Received from server -->severe. Sixty-eight percent called it ``very serious'' and 24percent said ``fairly serious.'' The remainder gave it lessimportance.
Received from server -->   The national poll, conducted by telephone among a random sampleof adults Nov. 10-20, had a 3-point margin of error. It was
Received from server -->completed before winter's cold increased attention on the homeless.   Still, nearly seven in 10 respondents said homelessness was
Received from server -->getting worse, a quarter said it was unchanged, and 3 percent sawimprovement. The remainder had no opinion.   Views were divided on the responsibility for solutions.
Received from server -->Thirty-two percent said the federal government was primarilyresponsible; 24 percent said state governments, 18 percent saidlocal governments and 9 percent said private charities. The rest had
Received from server -->no answer.   Wherever prime responsibility lies, only 27 percent said thefederal government was doing enough to prevent people from becominghomeless, and 58 percent said it was not. The remaining 15 percenthad no opinion.   A solid 60 percent said federal spending on programs for the
Received from server -->homeless should be increased, and 86 percent of that group said theywould be willing to pay higher taxes for that purpose. That totaled
Received from server -->52 percent overall, an unusually high level of acquiescence tohigher taxes.   On specific programs, 62 percent said the federal governmentshould spend more on housing for the homeless, and as many favored
Received from server -->the preventive measure of building more federally subsidized housing
Received from server -->for the poor.   In virtually all these measures, homelessness was seen as severeand worsening by a greater share of women, Democrats, liberals,minorities and younger people. They also were more apt to blamesociety and to favor a greater federal response.   Seventy-eight percent of women rated the problem as ``veryserious,'' compared with 56 percent of men, for example.Eighty-three percent of Democrats said it was getting worse,compared with 54 percent of Republicans. And sixty-four percent of
Received from server -->liberals said society was at fault, compared with 37 percent ofconservatives.
Received from server -->   An economic division also existed among respondents, with lowerincome Americans more likely to view the problem as serious and to
Received from server -->favor greater responses. Of those with family incomes less than$25,000 a year, for instance, 73 percent favored more subsidized
Received from server -->housing, but among those earning more than $50,000 just 54 percentagreed.   The survey found split views on the issue of people living on the
Received from server -->streets by choice. Of those with an opinion, 45 percent said peopleshould be allowed to live on the streets if they want to, but 51
Received from server -->percent said they should not have that right.   Finally, the survey asked who was mainly at fault forhomelessness _ society or the homeless themselves. Forty-fivepercent said society was primarily to blame; 33 percent said the
Received from server -->homeless and 22 percent had no answer.

Received from server -->   Aid to education, prison overcrowding, insurance reform, propertytax relief and the environment are among the issues challengingstate lawmakers this year, but none looms as large as the battle ofthe budget.
Received from server -->   It's income vs. spending, and if revenues are up, so are costs of
Received from server -->services. Just to stay even is more expensive, without talking aboutadding money for things like schools, road repair or social services.   ``What we face in the coming months will not be easy,''Connecticut Gov. William A. O'Neill said last week in hisstate-of-the-state address. ``We will have to say `No' when we
Received from server -->really want to say `Yes.'''   Some states, including Alaska, California, Connecticut, Iowa,
Received from server -->Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New York and West Virginia, arerunning in the red or face deficits in the coming fiscal year.
Received from server -->Others, like Illinois, have avoided deficits by no-frills budgetsand face a backlash from the lean years.
Received from server -->   A lucky few are running surpluses, heating up debate on what to
Received from server -->do with the largesse.   Caution abounds. New York and Massachusetts saw surpluses of afew years ago turn to deficits _ at least $636 million inMassachusetts' current $11.6 billion budget and more than $1 billionin New York's budget of more than $28 billion.
Received from server -->   States expecting to do well this year _ Hawaii, Kansas,
Received from server -->Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Idaho and Maryland _ arefearful of the same thing happening to them.   ``It's real easy to make a tax cut right now, and we all lookgood for re-election,'' says Hawaii House Finance Committee ChairmanJoseph Souki. ``But is that the wisest thing?''   Lawmakers, having read voters' lips, are loath to talk about
Received from server -->hiking taxes. The idea is being mentioned mainly in the states withthe biggest money woes, and the most likely candidates are increasedtaxes on cigarettes, alcohol and gasoline, rather than raising stateincome taxes.
Received from server -->   Spending on education has perhaps the highest priority. Even inWest Virginia, with a fiscal headache totaling $680 million,Gov.-elect Gaston Caperton has promised unspecified raises to thestate's teachers, who rank 46th nationally in salaries. Illinoiseducation officials, who have gone two years without a significant
Received from server -->budget increase, are expected to seek increases totaling more than
Received from server -->$600 million this year.   Coupled with increasing aid to education is the need in some
Received from server -->states to restructure the system for public school financing to
Received from server -->reduce the disparities between rich and poor districts. Montana'sLegislature must fashion a new system to replace one that a statecourt last year declared unconstitutional.   Prisons are another big-ticket item. Michigan is in the middle ofa massive prison building program; by 1991, the state will havespent $900 million to build 28 prisons, and if projections hold
Received from server -->true, the system still will be overcrowded.   ``The cost of operating prisons is eating us alive,'' saidMichigan Senate Appropriations Chairman Harry Gast.   Virginia is building two new prisons to increase its inmate
Received from server -->capacity by 2,600, but corrections officials say the state still
Received from server -->will be at least 1,000 beds short in a few years and more money willbe sought.
Received from server -->   ``The cost of crime is expensive, so we must accept the fact thatthe money drawn to support the criminal justice system is money that
Received from server -->we will not have for the wide range of other important needs
Received from server -->throughout the commonwealth,'' said Gov. Gerald L. Baliles.   Once lawmakers have their budget priorities settled, they stillwon't lack for issues.   Rising auto insurance costs are expected to be debated in New
Received from server -->Jersey, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. And California is awaitingthe results of a court challenge to Proposition 103, a voter
Received from server -->initiative passed last November that requires a 20 percent raterollback for most kinds of insurance and tougher state regulation ofinsurers.
Received from server -->   The environment and waste disposal is another sore spot for somestates. New Jersey suffered a second consecutive summer of beachclosings because of high bacteria levels and medical waste washingashore, and the Legislature passed a series of measures designed to
Received from server -->help clean up the state's ocean waters.   However, other proposals to track the disposal of medical waste,
Received from server -->impose tougher penalties on polluters and create a powerfulcommission to protect the coast remain mired in disputes.   South Carolina residents are clamoring for reductions in the
Received from server -->amount of hazardous waste buried in a landfill used by more than 30other states, and the Legislature is studying ways to deal with

Received from server --><TEXT>   A flock of ducks that waddle
Received from server -->through yards and dirty the streets has prompted a neighborhood
Received from server -->civil war of sorts in which both sides are crying foul about theother's tactics.
Received from server -->   The domesticated Muscovy duck population has swelled to 200,prompting some to begin efforts to reduce their numbers. The methods
Received from server -->have included egg stealing, trapping, maiming, and ducks being run
Received from server -->down by motorists.
Received from server -->   ``The ducks got caught in a people problem,'' says JimVanairsdale, a pro-duck member of a committee named by the City
Received from server -->Commission to try to resolve the yearlong dispute. ``It's sad whathas happened.''
Received from server -->   Those in favor of the ducks claim the animals were in theWoodland neighborhood when the middle- to upper-class area was
Received from server -->established more than 20 years ago. Opponents say the birds are too
Received from server -->aggressive, leave droppings underfoot and mate in public.   Many in this oceanside city of 3,200 people agreed the duck
Received from server -->population should be reduced, and the dispute has been focused on
Received from server -->how many ducks would be allowed. For some people, one Muscovy is oneduck too many.   A duck trapper was hired to relocate the ducks to Georgia, but
Received from server -->there were questions about the humaneness of his trapping methods.   The St. Augustine Humane Society helped catch others, but they
Received from server -->relocated them too close, enabling some to return.
Received from server -->   The ducks are such an emotional issue here that they dominated
Received from server -->three monthly meetings of the St. Augustine Beach City Commission.One meeting erupted into name-calling before Commissioner Pete
Received from server -->Dodson suggested last summer that a committee find a solution.   ``I agreed to act as a moderator. Two people from each side were
Received from server -->appointed to act as a committee,'' he said.
Received from server -->   ``We've got to live together and stop this monkey business.''   At the committee's first meeting, Dodson asked each member to
Received from server -->tell him how many ducks should be allowed.   The numbers began at zero, with the average being 17, which
Received from server -->became the standard.   Then Bill Van Marter, a former city commissioner who had
Received from server -->supported ridding the neighborhood of Muscovy ducks, complained inAugust that his wife and granddaughter were attacked by a rogue
Received from server -->drake in their back yard.   Mrs. Van Marter, who declined to be interviewed, told officials
Received from server -->at the time that she was forced to fling the bird, ``as big as aturkey,'' into a nearby palm tree to stop the attack.
Received from server -->   After the attack, the committee voted to reduce the Muscovypopulation to nine adult birds, where it stands.
Received from server -->   Efforts also were started to filch eggs from nests.
Received from server -->   But when reports surfaced that motorists were purposely runningdown the ducks and that ducks were being maimed by having their legs
Received from server -->hacked off, the dispute intensified.
Received from server -->   Kathryne Grove, who witnessed one of the ducks being run down,
Received from server -->said: ``I was sick at my stomach. Why would anyone have to murderthem or run them down?''
Received from server -->   During a recent 30-minute tour of the 80-home area, only sixducks were spotted, including one getting a douse from a hose
Received from server -->wielded by a woman trying to get it off her property.   The Florida Aubudon Society has little good to say about the
Received from server -->Muscovy ducks, a domesticated version of the wild ones in Mexico andSouth America.

Received from server -->   China today released a 33-year-old dissident who
Received from server -->was active in the pro-democracy movement in Shanghai and whose casewas taken up by the U.S. Congress.   Yang Wei, a former student at the University of Arizona, walked
Received from server -->from Ti Lan Qiao Prison in Shanghai today after serving one year of
Received from server -->a two-year sentence.
Received from server -->   Fu Fenghao, an official at the Shanghai Foreign Affairs office,said because Yang spent about a year in custody before beingsentenced, he was let out on time.
Received from server -->   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Yang said his
Received from server -->first concern upon release was the health of his father, who hascancer.   ``I'm going to see him today,'' said Yang. ``He is in the
Received from server -->hospital and he is in serious condition.''
Received from server -->   Yang was sentenced in December 1987 for ``demagogical propogandafor counterrevolutionary ends.''
Received from server -->   He had been held without charges since January 1987 in connectionwith pro-democracy student demonstrations in Shanghai in 1986.   Yang said he did not regret marching for democracy and writing
Received from server -->for ``China Spring,'' the banned periodical of the Chinese Alliance
Received from server -->for Democracy, a New York-based dissident group. But he said he wasunclear whether he would continue working for political change inChina.   ``I just got out,'' he said, ``so I don't really understandwhat's happening in society. When I determine that then I will make
Received from server -->a decision.''   Yang described his treatment in prison as ``pretty good.''
Received from server -->   ``It seemed that I was given special treatment,'' he said.   Yang, who received a master's degree in molecular biology fromArizona, said he wanted to return to the United States to continue
Received from server -->his studies.   Sources close to the family said Yang's release was delayed by
Received from server -->several hours today because three members of the Chinese Alliance
Received from server -->for Democracy were apprehended in Shanghai over the weekend withcopies of ``China Spring'' and a letter for Yang.   The alliance was set up in 1983 by a former Chinese citizen to
Received from server -->promote democracy in China. Chinese officials have declared it anillegal, reactionary organization.
Received from server -->   Two of the men _ Huang Han of Canada and Bell M.S. Wong, anAmerican who also goes by the name Huang Wencheng _ were ordered out
Received from server -->of China and flew to Hong Kong, the official China Daily said today.   The third man, Tang Guangzhong, flew back to the United States to
Received from server -->continue studies at Utah State University.
Received from server -->   The report said the three acknowledged they were members of thealliance. It also said they had admitted breaking the law.   It was not clear why Tang, a Chinese citizen, was allowed to
Received from server -->return to the United States.
Received from server -->   During Yang's trial in 1987, the court said he put up``reactionary slogans'' at Shanghai's Fudan University on Dec. 22,
Received from server -->1986 and sent letters to students in Canton and Beijing incitingthem to protest.
Received from server -->   Hundreds of thousands of students marched in dozens of cities
Received from server -->during the winter of 1986-87, calling for democracy.   On Dec. 3, 1987, the U.S. Congress passed an amendment to a StateDepartment appropriations bill calling for Yang's release, saying hehad broken no Chinese or U.S. laws.
Received from server -->   China called the amendment ``an undisguised interference inChina's internal affairs.''
Received from server -->   Yang's wife, Che Shaoli, lives in Houston and studiesmicrobiology at the Baylor College of Medicine.   She said she was thrilled at the news of his release.
Received from server -->   ``But I am sad, too,'' she said. ``I don't know when I will seehim.''

Received from server -->mostly in solitary confinement except for a weekly shower andinterrogation.
Received from server -->   He also confirmed reports that he had been tried, althoughbecause the trial was held in the Farsi language, said he had beenunaware he was serving a 3{-year sentence for possessing weapons,
Received from server -->the newspaper reported.   Nicola bought a ticket to Pakistan in 1986 in order to join theAfghan rebels fighting the Soviet-backed Communist government, the
Received from server -->Mail said.   ``My thoughts were to go and find the mujahedeen (Moslemguerrillas) ... so I could fight against the Russians,'' the weekly
Received from server -->paper quoted him as saying. Soviets troops have backed Afghanistan'scommunist government against the guerrillas in a decade-old conflict.   Dressed in Afghan clothes and carrying a rifle and pistol he had
Received from server -->bought at a market, Nicola told the paper he was in Pakistan on theborder with Iran when an Iranian patrol began running toward him.   ``I think they saw my guns,'' he was quoted as saying.   ``One fired two shots and, without thinking, I fired two shots

Received from server -->paper reported.   ``I have been too naive,'' he was quoted as saying. ``I had
Received from server -->romantic ideas from the movies. I know it isn't like that now.''
Received from server -->   His release was the latest sign of a thaw in relations betweenthe countries since they virtually cut diplomatic ties in 1987 aftera dispute which began when British police arrested an Iranian envoyon shoplifting charges.

Received from server -->   Share prices surged on the Tokyo Stock Exchangetoday in the first day of trading after Emperor Hirohito's death,and the dollar edged higher against the Japanese yen for the thirdconsecutive session.
Received from server -->   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected shares, a 25.75-pointgainer Friday, shot up 468.85 points, or 1.5 percent, closing at30,678.39 points, a record high. The previous record was 30,243.66
Received from server -->last Wednesday.   It was the largest one-day advance since Jan. 6, 1988.   Saturday's half-day session of stock trading was canceled after
Received from server -->Emperor Hirohito died of cancer early in the day.   A dealer at Nomura Securities said small investors were drawnback into the market after the emperor's death.   ``During his three-month-long illness, many individual investors
Received from server -->were extremely cautious and anxious about what might happen when theemperor died,'' said Michio Katsumata. ``But that's over now.''   Katsumata added that January is traditionally a bullish month for
Received from server -->the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and that investors also were responding to
Received from server -->positive economic conditions in Japan.   Buying interest gradually spread to institutional investors as
Received from server -->prices kept drifting higher through the day, other traders said.   Dealers said shares were bought on expectations of higher prices
Received from server -->ahead. Many economists have predicted Japan's economy will continue
Received from server -->to boom until the middle of this year, due partly to continuingdomestic demand.
Received from server -->   ``As much as it is discouraged by the death of Hirohito, the

Received from server -->division.   Kamemura said the yen's stability in Tokyo also is providing the

Received from server -->   Afghan guerrilla leaders refused today
Received from server -->to resume direct talks with the Soviets, accusing Moscow of playing
Received from server -->political games aimed at securing its communist proteges in Kabul a
Received from server -->place in a post-war government.
Received from server -->   The guerrillas promised not to attack departing Red Army troopsbut said their decision to break off negotiations means fighting islikely to continue after Feb. 15, when the 50,000 Soviet troopsremaining in Afghanistan are to withdraw under a U.N.-brokered
Received from server -->accord.   The Pakistan-based guerrilla leaders ended talks with Soviet
Received from server -->Deputy Foreign Minsiter Yuli Vorontsov on Saturday, deadlocked over
Received from server -->the composition of a post-war government but saying they were readyto meet again.   But Vorontsov later told reporters that Moscow would find a wayto support its Marxist allies in Kabul if a broad-based governmentthat includes communists is not in place Feb. 15.
Received from server -->   Moslem insurgents, who have been fighting the Soviet-backedcommunist regime in Kabul for a decade, have unanimously rejectedthe participation of any of its members in a post-war government.   Today, the spokesman for the U.S.-backed insurgents, SibghatullahMojaddidi told a news conference:
Received from server -->   ``Because the Soviets use threats, look for war rather thanpeace, and disrespect Afghans' right of self-determination, webelieve that negotiations are unproductive and unnecessary.   ``The Soviets have threatened that if their terms are not
Received from server -->accepted they will supply new weapons, not deployed before, to(Afghan President) Najib's regime after the withdrawal,'' said
Received from server -->Mojaddidi. ``The Soviets' efforts to impose a government of their
Received from server -->choice on the Afghan nation will protract the war and kill ourpeople.''
Received from server -->   Although Mojaddidi ruled out the cease-fire sought by Vorontsovbut promised that Moslem guerrillas, called mujahedeen or Islamic
Received from server -->holy warriors, would not attack departing Soviet soldiers.
Received from server -->   He said Vorontsov was told ``we can only order mujahedeen not toattack your withdrawing troops. We can give you peace . . . topass.''   The Soviet envoy has said Moscow will meet the February
Received from server -->withdrawal deadline unless departing Soviet soldiers are attacked byguerrillas.
Received from server -->   ``It could be delayed if there were all out fighting on Sovietforces, if there were attacks on Soviet forces withdrawing,''Vorontsov said earlier.
Received from server -->   More than 100,000 Red Army troops moved into Afghanistan inDecember 1979 and replaced one pro-Moscow regime with another. InApril, the Kremlin agreed to withdraw its forces by Feb.. Half hadleft by August.
Received from server -->   Vorontsov has been on a diplomatic mission since early December,seeking a political consensus on a broad-based government to stepinto the breach following the withdrawal.   He has met with the Iran- and Pakistan-based guerrilla groups,
Received from server -->which both agree that Najib's ruling party can play no part in apost-war government. About 3 million Afghan refugees live in
Received from server -->Pakistan, another 2 million in Iran.
Received from server -->   Modaddidi said the decision to break off the talks means fightingis likely to continue beyond Feb. 15.   He predicted that the guerrillas' allies, most notably the UnitedStates and Pakistan, will continue their support after the Red Armyleaves and predicted that the current Kabul government will collapse
Received from server -->within months of the final Soviet pullout.
Received from server -->   The Pakistan-based guerrilla alliance, the dominant insurgentforce, has said it plans to form a council that would, at the
Received from server -->collapse of Najib's government, choose a transitional governmentfrom within its ranks.   Both Pakistan- and Iran-based guerrillas would nominate councilmembers.</TEXT>

Received from server -->   ``It looks like this place has been bombed,'' Mayor Jack Loefflersaid Sunday from an emergency command post in a bank.
Received from server -->   Twisters hit the Illinois towns of Mill Shoals, Albion and
Received from server -->Allendale on Saturday afternoon before moving into Indiana andtouching down near Vincennes. Late Saturday, a tornado cut a

Received from server -->   ``After seeing everything that's happened, we were pretty lucky
Received from server -->no folks were hurt,'' said Simpson County Judge-Executive Ken Harperin Kentucky.   The National Guard was sent to the tornado-ravaged areas of
Received from server -->Illinois and Kentucky to help with the cleanup and to prevent

Received from server -->   On Sunday, the National Guard and other emergency workers clearedtrees and power lines that had been knocked down and other rubble
Received from server -->from streets, but hadn't made much headway on houses, said Gen.
Received from server -->Donald Lynn.   Police said people whose homes were destroyed were staying with
Received from server -->friends or relatives in town, and about a dozen were taken to

Received from server -->   Shocked officials and residents of this town of 600 assessed thedamage Sunday.   ``It's a mess is all you can say,'' said Allendale resident Linda
Received from server -->Griesemer. ``Houses are flattened, windows blowed out, roofs gone.''
Received from server -->   A damage estimate was not yet available, Loeffler said.   Gov. James R. Thompson toured Allendale and flew over the otheraffected areas. He said he planned to declare Allendale a statedisaster area.   ``It's a mess. It's awful,'' Thompson said. The tornado ``not
Received from server -->only took out a third of the homes, it took out almost the entiredowntown and all the public facilities.''   In Mill Shoals, two or three mobile homes were overturned and a
Received from server -->few homes and farm buildings were damaged. In Albion, five buildingswere damaged but there were no injuries, said Mayor Earl Bailey.   In Indiana, a twister came within a mile of Vincennes LincolnHigh School, where 2,500 people were watching a junior varsity
Received from server -->basketball game when the storm knocked the school's power out.   ``People are moving back into their homes and salvaging what theycan,'' Sheriff's Deputy Jerry Reitmeyer said Sunday. ``We were luckylast night.

Received from server -->   David O. Dodd took his secrets to the
Received from server -->grave after he was hanged at age 17 for being a Confederate spy 125years ago.   A coded message detailing Union positions around Little Rock
Received from server -->after the city fell to Union troops in September 1863 was found inhis boot.   But Dodd refused to answer questions or testify at a
Received from server -->court-martial.   Dodd was convicted of spying for the Confederacy and hanged Jan.8, 1864.
Received from server -->   On Sunday, Civil War enthusiasts gathered at Dodd's plot in MountHolly Cemetery to mark the 125th anniversary of his execution. About40 people _ half in Civil War dress _ stood in the cold as William
Received from server -->W. O'Donnell of Little Rock, author of articles about Dodd,proclaimed him the ``Boy Martyr of the Confederacy.''   ``It's a story of unbounded courage,'' O'Donnell said.
Received from server -->   A crowd of 6,000, some of whom walked across the frozen ArkansasRiver, witnessed Dodd's hanging near downtown Little Rock. Theexecution took five minutes, and wasn't over until a Union soldier
Received from server -->climbed the gallows to jerk the rope, O'Donnell said.
Received from server -->   ``Dodd was one of the youngest ever executed as a spy,'' saidJerry Russell, a member of the Civil War Roundtable of Arkansas.   Dodd's fate began to unravel in late December 1863. He traveledsouth from Little Rock, surrendering his pass to get through a Union
Received from server -->roadblock. After spending the night with a relative, Dodd headed
Received from server -->back toward the occupied city.
Received from server -->   ``The Union lines had moved out a couple of miles the next day.Since Dodd had surrendered his pass, he couldn't get through,''Russell said.
Received from server -->   ``There wasn't a real tight ring of steel around the town. Hemight have gotten through with his information. If Dodd had reallybeen the sneaky type, he would have gone through the woods.
Received from server -->Apparently, he was not sneakily inclined, and thought he could gothrough the roadblock.''
Received from server -->   The offer to betray his allies was extended to Dodd by Gen.Frederick Steele, who, ``in his written reports, felt really badabout it. He was very anguished over this thing, but they could notcondone spying,'' Russell said.
Received from server -->   Dodd also wouldn't tell why he was carrying the message, whichwas in Morse code. ``Why did he do it? Why? He never told anybody,''O'Donnell said. ``He never took the stand in his own defense. How
Received from server -->could a 17-year-old have so much courage to face the gallows withouttrying to escape?''   In a letter to his family on the day he died, Dodd wrote, ``I wasarrested as a Spy and tried, and Sentenced to be hung today at 3
Received from server -->o'clock. The time is fast approaching but thank God I am prepared to
Received from server -->die. I expect to meet you all in heaven. Do not weep for me for Iwill be better off in heaven.''   On Sunday, the Lord's Prayer and a 21-gun salute echoed in thewindswept cemetery. Seconds passed between each of the three volleys
Received from server -->as seven riflemen reloaded their black-powder weapons.
Received from server -->   Anthony Rushing, 26, of West Memphis, who wore a gray Civil Warcoat in the ceremony's color guard, said his image of Dodd comes asmuch from the heart as from the history books.
Received from server -->   ``He was done an injustice. I think they were trying to make anexample of him. He was a hero,'' Rushing said.

Received from server --><TEXT>   Emperor Akihito today set the tone for his reign by
Received from server -->pledging to work for peace and preserve Japanese democracy, but said
Received from server -->he faced ``awesome responsibilities'' after the death of his father,Hirohito.
Received from server -->   The four-minute speech was Akihito's first public statement sincehe ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne when Hirohito died of cancer
Received from server -->Saturday at age 87. It was delivered at the Imperial Palace during a
Received from server -->simple ceremony attended by Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and 237other dignitaries.
Received from server -->   Outside, hundreds of thousand of Japanese streamed past to pay
Received from server -->their respects to Hirohito, who reigned for 62 years.   ``Shrouded in sorrow and overwhelmed by the awesome
Received from server -->responsibilities I undertake, I stand humble before you,'' saidAkihito, who was clad in a black cutaway and gray trousers.
Received from server -->   ``I pledge myself to continue in the spirit of his late majesty,making his desire to constantly be at one with the people my desire
Received from server -->as well, joining together with you to preserve the constitution ofJapan, and thereby execute my duties faithfully,'' he added.
Received from server -->   Japan's post-war constitution, which bans the emperor from any
Received from server -->role in government and limits him to ceremonial functions, formedthe basis for the country's democracy. It limits the emperor's roleto signing bills into law and serving as ``symbol of the state andthe unity of the people.''   ``I do fervently desire the further development of Japan, peace
Received from server -->on Earth and enhanced well-being for all peoples,'' Akihito said.   He spoke clearly and solemnly, with the new Empress Michiko, 54,
Received from server -->on his left wearing a black dress and veil and their son, Crown
Received from server -->Prince Naruhito, 28, on his right.   By Japanese tradition, Akihito's statement was his first Imperial
Received from server -->Rescript, in which a new emperor sets a tone for his reign.
Received from server -->   The rite, in the palace's main ceremonial hall, was an important
Received from server -->milestone in the transition to Akihito's new imperial era of Heisei,
Received from server -->or ``Achieving Peace.''
Received from server -->   On Sunday, Hirohito's body was wrapped in a white cloth andplaced in a coffin made of Japanese cypress at the palace in
Received from server -->preparation for the Feb. 24 burial. Representatives of more than 130countries, including up to 50 heads of state or government, are
Received from server -->expected to attend.
Received from server -->   Hirohito's era, called Showa, or ``Enlightened Peace,'' endedwith his death, and according to Japanese tradition he becomes known
Received from server -->as Emperor Showa. His reign stretched from Japan's descent intomilitarism and defeat in World War II to its impressive recovery
Received from server -->into an economic superpower.
Received from server -->   Thousands of police were deployed today to prevent violence byradical leftist and rightist groups, for whom the emperor embodies
Received from server -->Japanese militarism and nationalism.   Hirohito was revered as a living god until he was forced to
Received from server -->renounce his divinity at the end of World War II, and Japanese
Received from server -->soldiers fought and died during the war in the monarch's name.   Two old soldiers have hanged themselves since learning of
Received from server -->Hirohito's passing, saying in suicide notes that they wanted to
Received from server -->follow the emperor in death. An 87-year-old former army man hangedhimself Saturday, and the body of a former navy officer was found
Received from server -->Sunday hanging from a tree in a temple compound.
Received from server -->   Mourners continued to stream to the palace today to sign
Received from server -->condolence registers outside the main gate. On Sunday, the palacesaid 438,376 people braved drizzling rain to honor the late emperorat the palace, and the number of signers today had reached 223,020
Received from server -->by 3:30 p.m.   Japan's stock market today boomed to a record high closing and
Received from server -->its biggest gain in a year in the first session since Hirohito'sdeath.
Received from server -->   A dealer at Nomura Securities said small investors were drawnback into the market after the emperor's death.
Received from server -->   ``During his three-month-long illness, many individual investorswere extremely cautious and anxious about what might happen when theemperor died,'' said Michio Katsumata. ``But that's over now.''</TEXT></DOC>

Received from server -->   The 12-week-old jetliner that crashed in Englandwas the first involving a Boeing 737-400, a model introduced last
Received from server -->year, a Boeing Co. spokesman said.   The British Midland Airways jet, carrying 126 people, crashedSunday while attempting an emergency landing about 10 minutes after
Received from server -->leaving London's Heathrow Airport en routeto Belfast. Authoritiessaid at least 37 people were killed.
Received from server -->   Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said the aircraft was purchased lastfall by GPA Leasing in Shannon, Ireland, which leased it to BritishMidland. He said it is the first accident involving a 737-400 or a737-300, which is 10 feet shorter than the 400 series.
Received from server -->   The 737-400 was certified by the Federal Aviation Administrationin September and 17 of the $28 million to $32 million jets are inuse, Gamble said Sunday.
Received from server -->   British Midland chairman Michael Bishop said the company had
Received from server -->taken delivery of the twin-engine plane only 12 weeks ago. He said
Received from server -->the plane reported severe vibrations in one of the engines abouteight minutes into the flight. Witnesses said one of the engines wason fire as it attempted to land at an airport about 100 miles north
Received from server -->of London.   Gamble said the engine used on both 737 models is the CFM-56,
Received from server -->which is built in France by a consortium made up of General Electricand SMECMA, a French concern.   He said the engines are brought to the United States and
Received from server -->reassembled and tested at a General Electric plant near Cincinnati.
Received from server -->The completed engines are shipped to the Boeing plant at Renton, asuburb of Seattle, where the 737 is manufactured.   The CFM-56 has been the world's top-selling commercial jet engine
Received from server -->during the past two years surpassing GE's rival, Pratt &amp; WhitneyAircraft, in the market for powering standard-body jets of
Received from server -->short-to-medium-range routes.   More than 5,900 of the engines have been sold to more than 100operators since the engine entered service in 1982.
Received from server -->   Dwight E. Weber, a spokesman for CFM International and the GEaircraft engine business group, declined to speculate on the rolethe CFM-56 may have played in Sunday's crash.
Received from server -->   ``We'll be working with the airline to determine the cause,''Weber said Sunday. ``Once the cause is determined, if it's
Received from server -->engine-related, we'll be working with the customers who operate theengine to determine if it's an isolated case or a fleetwideprogram.''
Received from server -->   A Boeing team was to travel to England today aboard a 737-300that was being delivered to British Midland, said David Jimenez,another Boeing spokesman.   The 737-400 was rolled out in January 1988, and the first flight
Received from server -->was in March. Depending on the interior design, the jet can seat 130to 150 passengers.</TEXT>

Received from server --><TEXT>   With the Super Bowl less than two weeks away,

Received from server -->the football extravaganza.   That's the going price for an air-conditioned skybox seating nineat the 75,000-seat Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami where the Super Bowlwill be played Jan. 22.   ``It's like an apartment,'' said Raquel Barouh, who is fieldinginquiries for the $20,000 skybox offering. ``It's worth the price.''   The National Football League doles out Super Bowl tickets to the
Received from server -->league's 28 teams, with the most going to the competing teams andthe host city. The teams decide how to distribute their allotment.   The NFL forbids the sale of tickets for a premium, and scalping

Received from server -->   The Cincinnati Bengals and the San Francisco 49ers won decisiveconference championships Sunday to advance to the Super Bowl and a

Received from server -->defeated Buffalo 21-10 to win the American Football Conference. The49ers beat the Chicago Bears 28-3 for the National Football
Received from server -->Conference title.   Larry Reader, a salesman who lives near Indianapolis, bought 10tickets for customers, paying $500 for six seats in the end zone and
Received from server -->$850 apiece for four seats on the 25-yard line.   Wendy Lester of Miami wrote in a classified ad appeal: ``Help my

Received from server -->   Kids can sure make a mess. But admittedly,4-year-old Ian Loizeaux made a bigger mess than most.   One push of a button by the preschooler Sunday brought an

Received from server -->   Investigators today recovered the flightrecorders from the wreckage of a new Boeing 737 that crashed along ahighway after one engine, and possibly both, failed. At least 43people were killed and 83 injured.
Received from server -->   Firefighters pumped foam onto the crumpled jet to prevent seepingaviation fuel from catching fire. The Belfast-bound jet carrying 126people broke into three pieces on the edge of Britain's main
Received from server -->north-south highway, the M1, in central England on Sunday night.   The twin-engine Boeing 737-400 narrowly missed the small town of
Received from server -->Kegworth and plowed into an embankment just a few hundred yardsshort of the runway as the pilot struggled to make an emergency
Received from server -->landing at East Midland Airport, 100 miles north of London.   One engine was on fire, and Transport Secretary Paul Channon said
Received from server -->it ``certainly looks probable'' there was a problem with the secondengine.
Received from server -->   British Midland Airways said sabotage was not suspected in thecrash, which came less than three weeks after a bomb blew apart Pan
Received from server -->Am Flight 103 over a Scottish village, Lockerbie, killing all 259people on board and 11 on the ground.   Witnesses and a radio operator who monitored the pilot's final
Received from server -->exchanges with air traffic controllers Sunday also said both enginesappeared to have failed.
Received from server -->   British Midland said the jet was delivered just 12 weeks ago andhad flown less than 500 hours. It grounded its other 737-400 for
Received from server -->inspection.
Received from server -->   ``At the moment it does seem to be a technical problem,'' saidPaul Beaver, a managing editor of aviation for Jane's publications.
Received from server -->``I think they have ruled out pilot error and almost definitelyruled out sabotage.''   Beaver, interviewed on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,'' said
Received from server -->the chances of both engines failing were ``something like a 10
Received from server -->million to one chance, and of course sometimes those chances comeup.''   At least four British soldiers serving in Northern Ireland wereamong the 43 killed, police said.
Received from server -->   ``It's amazing'' no motorists or nearby residents were killed,
Received from server -->Leicestershire Assistant Chief Constable Tony Butler told a newsconference today. ``It's a very busy road.''   Channon said the fast response of emergency services saved lives.
Received from server -->   ``The airport fire brigade was there within minutes ... a numberof people are living as a result.''
Received from server -->   Police said the last person was taken from the wreckage more thanseven hours after the crash. They said it took 2{ hours to extract
Received from server -->the pilot, Kevin Hunt. A spokeswoman for the Leicester RoyalInfirmary said Hunt was in poor condition with multiple injuries.
Received from server -->   The plane took off from London's Heathrow Airport at 7:52 p.m.,and about eight minutes later reported ``severe vibrations in one of
Received from server -->the engines,'' said airline chairman Michael Bishop.   The pilot reported an engine on fire, then said he had it undercontrol and asked for clearance to make an emergency landing at East
Received from server -->Midlands Airport, the airline's home base 100 miles north of London.   Witnesses said the left engine was on fire as the plane crashed
Received from server -->about a half-mile shy of the runway. Ham radio operator MervynSolloway said that from what he could hear, both engines were in
Received from server -->trouble.   ``Suddenly there was, not a shouted message, but a bit of a
Received from server -->frantic one to say, `We've got problems with the other engine.' Thatwas the last I heard from the aircraft,'' he said.
Received from server -->   The aircraft sheared tree tops and plowed into a steep embankmentby the M1 highway outside the town of Kegworth. A piece of the jetlodged in the highway divider and bodies and personal belongings
Received from server -->spilled from the plane.   Motorists swerved in terror and some cars collided, police said.The tail section embedded in the ground while the fuselage tore
Received from server -->apart, the nose section coming to rest in a bramble thicket.   Dozens of fire engines, ambulances, residents and motoristsrushed to the scene. The engine fire was quickly extinguished, and
Received from server -->rescuers cut passengers loose. Surgeons performed amputations on thespot.
Received from server -->   A local Episcopal vicar, the Rev. Michael Brandon, recited theLord's Prayer as a man died, clutching his hand.   ``The whole plane is carnage,'' said Vic Milner, an Automobile
Received from server -->Association worker. ``People were strapped into their seats, dead inthe tangled body of the plane.''   Several people in Kegworth, a town of 2,000 residents, said that
Received from server -->when the plane crashed, their first thought was of Lockerbie, thelittle Scottish town that bore the brunt of the crash of Pan Am
Received from server -->Flight 103 on Dec. 21.   All 259 people aboard that Boeing 747 were killed, along with 11Lockerbie residents. Investigators said a bomb blew up the plane.
Received from server -->   In Sunday's crash, ``there nothing to indicate (sabotage)whatsoever,'' said the airline's marketing director, Colin Roberts.
Received from server -->   David Learmount of the respected journal Flight Internationalsaid the British Midland plane must have developed ``more than just
Received from server -->a simple engine failure or the pilot could have gotten the planedown safely.''   He told British Broadcasting Corp. television said the Boeing
Received from server -->737-400 has ``the most brilliant safety record in the world today.''   ``If an airplane's engine catches fire one of the reasons why is
Received from server -->that the engine, which has very fast spinning parts, literallybreaks apart and bits come out through the casing and this can cause
Received from server -->a fire,'' he said.   In Seattle, Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said Sunday's crash was
Received from server -->the first involving a 737-400. The model had its first flight inMarch and airlines are flying 17 of the jets, he said.

Received from server --><TEXT>   All five candidates for chairman of the Democratic
Received from server -->National Committee played to their Southern audience at a weekendmeeting, with the stress on luring moderate and conservative
Received from server -->Southern whites back to the party.   The five candidates met about 100 committee members and party
Received from server -->activists Sunday.   ``I don't want to run a party that writes off the South,'' said
Received from server -->Washington lawyer Ronald H. Brown, who has served in top party postsand served as Jesse Jackson's 1988 convention manager. ``It doesn't
Received from server -->make sense. You can't do it that way.''   Brown and Michigan party Chairman Richard N. Wiener, who is
Received from server -->president of the Association of State Democratic Chairs, areconsidered favorites. But neither candidate has a majority of the
Received from server -->404-member DNC, and party leaders believe one of three dark horsescould win the Feb. 10 election.   They are former Reps. Michael D. Barnes of Maryland, James R.
Received from server -->Jones of Oklahoma and James V. Stanton of Ohio.   While many party chairmen in the West and Midwest have rallied
Received from server -->around Wiener, most Southern chairmen have remained uncommitted.   Much of the talk Sunday concerned changing the public'sperception of the Democratic message. President-elect George Bushswept the South in the November elections, just as most Republican
Received from server -->candidates have done for a generation.   ``The perception is that we are to the left, are much moreliberal, than the mainstream voters,'' Jones said. ``Unless anduntil we recognize that, unless and until we bring the party to a
Received from server -->position that is viewed as centrist and representing the vastmajority of this very diverse country, we're not going to winelections.''   Jones advocated a three-year advertising campaign that wouldattempt to ``make it respectable to be a Democrat again.''
Received from server -->   Wiener said Republicans have put six hurdles in the path ofDemocrats running for president: the issues of national defense,patriotism, crime, gun control, school prayer and abortion.
Received from server -->   ``We don't have to be to the right of the Republicans on thoseissues,'' he said. ``But we need to pass a certain threshold onthose issues.''   He suggested imitating the GOP practice of spending heavily onissues research, to identify Democratic strengths and Republicanweaknesses.
Received from server -->   Southerners remained uncommitted after the meeting.   James Van Hecke Jr., the North Carolina party chairman, said theSouthern chairmen may hold a telephone conference later this week toexplore the possibility of a group endorsement.
Received from server -->   Several of the Southern party leaders in the audience said theyappreciated the lip service paid to regional concerns but heard fewspecific solutions.   ``Everybody has said to us for years that the South is the key,
Received from server -->and not one of these candidates disagreed,'' said Alan Diamonstein,chairman of the DNC's Southern caucus. ``But you can't keep sayingthat mathematically the South is the key while not saying how to doanything about it.''

Received from server -->   The annual survey nonetheless found that students enteringcollege in 1988 were more likely than their 1987 counterparts towant to pursue graduate study despite the financial obstacles.   And although students are more interested in making money, theyseem less interested in business careers as a means of reaching that
Received from server -->goal, the survey said.   At the same time, a record proportion of freshmen reportedthemselves feeling frequently depressed. Stress over paying forcollege and attaining advanced degrees were possible contributingfactors.   The findings released Sunday by the American Council on Educationand the Higher Education Research Institute at the University ofCalifornia at Los Angeles are based on questionnaires filled out by308,007 freshmen entering 585 two-and four-year colleges anduniversities. The results were adjusted to reflect the totalpopulation of 1.64 million first-time, full-time entering studentsand have a margin of error of plus or minus two points.
Received from server -->   Only 15.6 percent of freshmen entering school last fall receivedPell grants, the government's major aid program for low- andmiddle-income students, the survey found. That was the lowest levelsince the survey began 23 years ago and less than half the 31.5percent who received Pell grants in 1980.
Received from server -->   Freshman participation in other federal aid programs also fell,while students reported greater reliance on family contributions,savings, loans and institutional grants.   The amount of Pell grant aid awarded to students actually rosenearly 57 percent from 1980 to 1988, or 17 percent taking inflation
Received from server -->into account, according to The College Board, a New York-basedlobbying group.   But during the same period, the aid was more sharply aimed at thevery neediest post-secondary students, many of whom shun college in
Received from server -->favor of vocational schools that teach cosmetology, art, drama, automechanics, business skills or other trades.   Victoria Tripp, an Education Department spokeswoman, said 11percent of Pell money went to vocational students in 1980, comparedwith 27 percent in 1988. ``That figure will increase to one-third in
Received from server -->the early 1990s,'' she predicted. ``The money is targeted to thosestudents and there has been a proliferation of those schools.''   Despite the falloff in college aid, a record proportion offreshmen said they were interested in pursuing advanced degrees _
Received from server -->58.7 percent, compared with 48.3 percent in 1980.   ``The rising degree aspirations suggest that a growing proportionof students feel the bachelor's degree will not be an adequatecredential in the job market during the next decade and into thenext century,'' said Kenneth C. Green, associate director of thesurvey.   In line with that, a record 72.6 percent of the freshmen
Received from server -->indicated ``making more money'' was a very important factor in theirdecision to attend college. By contrast, the proportion who saidthey were going to college ``to gain a general education'' declinedfor the 11th straight year, to 60.1 percent.   Examining personal habits, the survey also found that a 22-year
Received from server -->decline in smoking may be reversing itself. In 1966, 16.6 percent ofthe freshmen said they were frequent smokers. That fell steadily to8.9 percent in 1987, but rose to 10.1 percent among those enteringcollege last fall.

Survey director Alexander Astin of UCLA said the survey revealedseveral potential sources of increased stress for students,including concern about paying for college; increased interest inadvanced degrees; and tougher competition for admission to selectiveinstitutions.   On the career front, the survey found that freshman interest in

Received from server -->   Iran's foreign minister said today that prospectsfor success in Iran-Iraq peace talks are dim, but he said hiscountry is ready to agree to an international ban on chemicalweapons whether or not Iraq signs.
Received from server -->   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, attending an internationalconference on chemical weapons, said he had met with U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to discuss the 8-year-oldIran-Iraq war.
Received from server -->   A cease-fire began Aug. 20 and negotiations aimed at achieving alasting peace began a few days later.   ``The situation remains volatile and prospects for progress aredim,'' Velayati told reporters. ``Five months after the cease-fire,
Received from server -->Iraq is still in our territory.''   Tehran Radio said today, ``The Islamic Republic has alwaysdemonstrated its willingness to participate in the talks, but until(while) Iraq continues to introduce subterfuges, a resumption of
Received from server -->talks will achieve nothing.''   The commentary, monitored in Nicosia, gave the strongestindication yet that Iran may not return to the negotiating tablewithout guarantees of concrete results.   The U.N. Security Council and all countries which support its
Received from server -->cease-fire resolution ``must not expect Iran to be optimistic aboutthe talks until (while) Iraq still refuses to withdraw from Iranianterritory,'' said the broadcast.   Tehran's accusation that Baghdad is dragging its feet comesseveral days after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein claimed Iran wasmassing troops along the 730-mile border and probably planning ``new
Received from server -->aggression.'' He also accused Tehran of stalling in the peace talks.   In Paris, Velayati said Perez de Cuellar is sending high-levelenvoys to Baghdad and Tehran soon, and ``we welcome them.''   Iraq has used chemical weapons, and Velayati called hiscountrymen ``the most conspicuous victims'' of violations of the
Received from server -->1925 Geneva Protocol, which bans the use of such weapons. Iraqadmitted using chemical weapons in the war but said Iran used themfirst.   Velayati repeated Iranian claims that his country did not use theweapons.
Received from server -->   Asked if Iran would be willing to sign an accord expanding thechemical weapons ban if Iraq refused to sign, Velayati said: ``Weare ready to participate in any global or regional activities onchemical weapons.''
Received from server -->   Velayati also said he met early today with William Waldegrave,head of the British delegation, to discuss British hostages beingheld in Lebanon.   He said Iran had been asked for help and that in the past they
Received from server -->had tried to assist ``France, West Germany, even the United States''in obtaining freedom for hostages held in Lebanon.   ``We do hope all nationals will be released,'' he said.   Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are held hostage in

Wasteful programs continued to be funded.   The necessary reductions have still not been made.

Received from server --><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today agreed to decidewhether Congress may outlaw all sexually explicit telephone dial-up
Received from server -->message services, known as ``dial-a-porn.''   The justices will rule, sometime by July, on the validity of a
Received from server -->1988 law that sought to ban all obscene and indecent messagesavailable through dial-a-porn services.
Received from server -->   A federal judge in California ruled that the law could be appliedto ban all obscene messages, but he struck down the law's ban on
Received from server -->messages deemed merely indecent.   U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima in Los Angeles based his
Received from server -->July 19 ruling on past Supreme Court decisions that excluded obscenematerial _ but not all sexually explicit or indecent material _ from
Received from server -->constitutional free-speech protections.   The Reagan administration appealed directly to the Supreme Court,challenging the part of the July ruling that protects indecent

Received from server -->dial-a-porn services in that state, filed a counter-appealchallenging the part of Tashima's ruling that allows the ban on
Received from server -->materials judged to be obscene.   Today, the justices granted review to both appeals.   Twice in 1988 the justices had refused to review dial-a-porn
Received from server -->controversies, in cases from Arizona and New York.   Obscenity is a legal term that does not apply to all sexually
Received from server -->explicit material.   The Supreme Court since 1973 has defined obscenity as a work that
Received from server -->appeals to a morbid interest in sex with patently offensivedepictions or descriptions of sexual conduct, and one that taken as

Received from server -->   Upholding the government's power to punish use of ``dirty words''over the airwaves at times when children might be listening, the

Received from server -->of indecent language ``suggests that (the 1988 law) is consistentwith the First Amendment,'' the constitutional protection of freedom
Received from server -->of speech.   The government's appeal acknowledged, however, that the FCC's

Received from server -->whether the Justice Department must supply a weekly tax magazinewith copies of all federal trial court opinions and orders in tax
Received from server -->cases.   The justices said they will review a ruling that the Freedom of
Received from server -->Information Act imposes such an obligation on the JusticeDepartment's tax division.
Received from server -->   Government lawyers, warning of ``enormous administrative costsand burdens'' at taxpayer expense, contend that the 1966 law imposes
Received from server -->no such obligation.   Tax Analysts, a Washington-based weekly magazine reporting
Received from server -->legislative, judicial and regulatory developments in federal
Received from server -->taxation, first invoked the FOIA in 1984 in seeking timely copies offederal court opinions and orders from the Justice Department.   Such opinions and orders are available to the public from the
Received from server -->individual courts but the magazine had difficulty in obtaining them
Received from server -->quickly.   The Justice Department's tax division turned down the magazine'sFOIA requests, and a federal trial judge upheld the denial.   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last April 29that the government must comply with the magazine's FOIA requests.   ``Imposing an enormous and costly administrative burden on theJustice Department to secure already publicly available material for
Received from server -->a commercial publication is certainly not the commonly perceived
Received from server -->purpose of the FOIA,'' the appeals court said. ``Nonethleless, we
Received from server -->cannot find in the words of the statute any exemption to cover sucha situation.''   The appeals court added that ``the burden in this case may not beso excessive as the department makes out.''   Government lawyers estimate that complying with the Tax Analysts
Received from server -->requests on a regular basis would cost nearly $75,000 a year for
Received from server -->search time alone.   They say commercial publishers and law firms would flood theJustice Department with similar FOIA requests if the appeals courtruling is not overturned.
Received from server -->   The appeals court ruled that federal trial court opinions andorders sent to the Justice Department are ``agency records'' underthe FOIA, and that they are being ``improperly withheld'' from thetax magazine.
Received from server -->   In the appeal acted on today, government lawyers said the appealscourt was wrong on both points.   The case is Justice Department vs. Tax Analysts, 88-782.</TEXT>

Received from server -->shelter and then survived an avalanche after getting lost during a
Received from server -->sudden storm on Mount Rainier.   ``It was an extremely calm and well-organized group, which reallymade a big difference,'' Lonnie Rosenwald, 33, of Seattle. Theirordeal ended safely Sunday when the group members met up with a
Received from server -->rescue team on their way down the mountain.   Still, she said, ``There were lots of times we thought our lives
Received from server -->were in danger. There were times we didn't think we were going toget out of there.''
Received from server -->   The skiers, all experienced at wilderness survival, left Saturday
Received from server -->on what was supposed to be a one-day back-country ski trip to the
Received from server -->Muir snowfield on the south flank of the 14,410-foot mountain. While
Received from server -->they were attempting to return that afternoon, a storm closed in andthey got lost in a steep valley, Rosenwald said.   The skiers, on a trip sponsored by the Seattle Mountaineers Club,tried until midnight to climb out of the valley and then decided to
Received from server -->build a structure and a small fire to survive the night.
Received from server -->   ``It was a wonderful structure,'' said Rosenwald. ``It was a

Received from server --><TEXT>   A mother jailed since August 1987 for refusingto disclose the whereabouts of her daughter, whom she says was
Received from server -->sexually abused by the child's father, lost a Supreme Court appealtoday.   The justices, without comment, let stand a contempt citationagainst Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, a District of Columbia plastic surgeon.
Received from server -->   Morgan, 41, was imprisoned in August 1981 for defying an order by
Received from server -->District of Columbia Judge Herbert B. Dixon Jr. that she allow her
Received from server -->daughter, Hilary, then 5, to spend a two-week unsupervised visitwith Dr. Eric A. Foretich.
Received from server -->   Foretich is Hilary's father and Morgan's former husband.
Received from server -->   Morgan sent the child into hiding to protect her, she said, fromsexual abuse by Foretich, who has denied abusing his daughter.   The judge last Dec. 15 refused to free Morgan after more than 15months in jail, saying he is not convinced her imprisonment will
Received from server -->fail to coerce her into disclosing Hilary's whereabouts.   ``The coercion has only just begun,'' Dixon said. He added, ``It
Received from server -->could be a month, it could be a year, it could be more than that''
Received from server -->before he is convinced ``there is no realistic possibility of her
Received from server -->relenting.''   Morgan has been held in civil contempt, imposed to coerce someoneinto complying with a court order. The citation requires
Received from server -->imprisonment for an indefinite period. Criminal contempt, bycontrast, is imposed for a limited sentence as punishment.   In her Supreme Court appeal, Morgan said her rights were violatedbecause Dixon conducted much of the hearing that led to the contemptcitation in private.
Received from server -->   The judge said he was trying to protect Hilary from public
Received from server -->disclosure of the details of her father's alleged sexual abuse. Manyof the specific charges were made public in a separate federal courtsuit against Foretich by Morgan.   Dixon ruled in 1986 that Morgan failed to prove Foretich had
Received from server -->abused Hilary. He said there was equal evidence on both sides of thecase. The judge permitted brief supervised visits for the father,
Received from server -->and in August 1987 granted Foretich a two-week unsupervised visit
Received from server -->that led Morgan to send her daughter into hiding.
Received from server -->   Morgan said Dixon was biased against her, and wrongly refused tobelieve evidence indicating Hilary had been abused.   An appeals court here ruled last August that Morgan's rights werenot violated.
Received from server -->   ``A review of the record shows that there was proabable evidence
Received from server -->on both sides of the issue of abuse,'' the appeals court said. Itadded that it is unable to conclude that Dixon was ``clearlyerroneous'' in granting Foretich a two-week visit.   The appeals court noted that a court-appointed guardian forHilary opposed the visit but had not argued that Dixon abused his
Received from server -->discretion in ordering the visit.
Received from server -->   The appeals court also upheld Dixon's decision to bar the publicfrom hearing Morgan's testimony about specific alleged acts ofsexual abuse.   Morgan said the public has been prevented from hearing crucialevidence that is vital to an issue of national debate.
Received from server -->   Her lawyers said studies show that sex abuse charges are made insome 2 percent of contested custody and visitation cases.
Received from server -->   Calling the figure one of ``alarming frequency,'' they saiddoubts have been raised about the ability of judges to referee suchdisputes.
Received from server -->   Growing numbers of ``desperate parents have ... taken their
Received from server -->children and disappeared'' because the parents ``have lost faith inthe willingness and ability of the judicial system to protect theirchildren,'' Morgan's appeal said.   The case is Morgan vs. Foretich, 88-737.

Received from server --><BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today agreed to decidewhether federal courts should referee some disputes over electricpower rates between public utilities and local or state regulatoryagencies.
Received from server -->   The justices said they will hear an appeal by New Orleans Public
Received from server -->Service Inc., a utility company seeking to pass on to its customers
Received from server -->$135 million in costs.   The high court, in a related ruling last June, severely limitedthe authority of states to lower electric rates that publicutilities charge as a result of agreements with federal regulators.   But that decision left unanswered whether federal judges should
Received from server -->rule in such disputes or leave these matters to state courts.
Received from server -->   The case acted on today stems from a nearly decade-old disputebetween New Orleans Public Service, or NOPSI, and the city council,which under Louisiana law sets utility rates charged consumers inNew Orleans.
Received from server -->   The council barred NOPSI from charging customers for the coststhe utility incurred in buying electric power generated by the $3.6
Received from server -->billion Grand Gulf 1 nuclear power plant in Port Gibson, Miss.
Received from server -->   The rates charged NOPSI to purchase power from Grand Gulf wereset by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.   Therefore, NOPSI argued, city and state officials are powerlessto prevent it from passing on the costs to its customers.
Received from server -->   The federal commission in 1985 ordered NOPSI to pay 17 percent ofthe cost of constructing Grand Gulf 1.
Received from server -->   NOPSI, in a partial settlement with the city council in 1986,agreed to absorb $51.2 million of the costs of Grand Gulf.
Received from server -->   NOPSI said the city gave assurances it would be allowed to
Received from server -->recover the remaining $135 million share of its costs through higherretail rates over a period of time.   But the council said the utility acted imprudently in failing toresell the power it agreed to purchase from Grand Gulf and blocked apass-through.   NOPSI sued in federal court for permission to pass on the $135
Received from server -->million to its customers, arguing that the federal commission's rolein the matter preempted the city council's power.   A federal judge denied NOPSI's claim, and the 5th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals upheld the ruling last July.
Received from server -->   The appeals court said, ``A federal court with jurisdiction overa matter that also lies within the jurisdiction of a state court or
Received from server -->agency should abstain from exercising its jurisdiction. New Orleans
Received from server -->Public Service must seek relief elsewhere.''   The Reagan administration urged the Supreme Court to overrule the5th Circuit court and order the federal courts to decide the dispute.
Received from server -->   The Justice Department said that at the very least it should bemade clear that federal courts have power to allow utilities to pass
Received from server -->on such costs temporarily to customers while the case is pending inthe courts.   ``A delay in passing those costs through in retail rates will
Received from server -->often have consequences that are irreparable,'' government lawyers
Received from server -->said. ``It may create immediate cash flow problems and uncertaintiesthat may threaten bankruptcy, impede securities offerings and forcecompromise settlements.''   The case is New Orleans Public Service vs. New Orleans CityCouncil, 88-348.</TEXT></DOC><DOC><DOCNO> AP890109-0073 </DOCNO><FILEID>AP-NR-01-09-89 1036EST</FILEID>

Received from server --><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   George Bush today studied President Reagan's$1.15 trillion budget, and a transition official said thepresident-elect ``agrees with its intent'' although still planned to
Received from server -->submit his own modifications.
Received from server -->   Bush transition spokeswoman Sheila Tate said that the vicepresident himself might issue a brief statement on it later in theday.   But another transition official, who spoke on condition of
Received from server -->anonymity, said that Bush was prepared to say that Reagan's spending
Received from server -->outline ``says for one thing that you can meet theGramm-Rudman-Hollings targets without raising taxes.''   It was a reference to the federal spending law that limits thedeficit in the fiscal 1990 year _ the one the new budget covers _ tono more than $100 billion. The Reagan document envisions a $92.5
Received from server -->billion deficit.
Received from server -->   ``It's a good budget that does that,'' the Bush transitionofficial continued. ``Naturally, he agrees with its intent. And,
Received from server -->naturally, he'll have his own recommendations, or put forthpotential amendments, once he takes office.''   ``But he won't be presenting any of those recommendations untilhe's prepared to present all of them to the Congress, whatever time
Received from server -->that might be,'' the official said.   The Reagan budget was designed, in part, to smooth the way for
Received from server -->the upcoming Bush budget plan, Reagan administration and Bush
Received from server -->transition officials said.   Outgoing Budget Director Joseph R. Wright Jr. said Sunday thefinal Reagan budget was designed with a ``dual purpose'' in mind,
Received from server -->summing up Reagan's philosophy while providing Bush ``with a goodbase to begin negotiations with Congress.''   Bush himself has said he won't submit a completely new plan ofhis own, but will outline what he'll ``add here and take offthere,'' much of it to be spelled out in an address to a jointsession of Congress in early February.
Received from server -->   Congressional Democratic leaders have indicated they would like
Received from server -->to get Bush's final budget plan by no later than Feb. 20 so Congress
Received from server -->can begin work on its own budget and meet the goal of finishing workon spending bills before the August recess.   And leaders are indicating they are giving Bush the benefit ofthe doubt on his much-touted concept of a ``flexible freeze'' to
Received from server -->hold overall spending increases generally to the rate of inflation _but without a tax increase.   ``My own view is that is very difficult,'' Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell, D-Maine, said Sunday on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.''   But, he continued: ``(Bush) has said it can be done and that he
Received from server -->will do it. ... My feeling is let's give him a chance to see if he
Received from server -->meant what he said and if he can do what he promised.''
Received from server -->   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, appearing on thesame program, said he believes Bush is committed to his campaignpledge not to raise taxes. ``I think George Bush meant it and if
Received from server -->people don't read lips in this town, I think they are going to be
Received from server -->left out somewhere,'' Dole said.   Reagan's final gift to Bush is a fiscal 1990 budget document thatappears to meet that mathematical goal. Reagan's plan calls forspending increases of 4.5 percent _ comparable to the 1988 rate of
Received from server -->inflation of about 4.4 percent.   Under the Bush ``flexible freeze,'' any increased spending mustbe offset in general by reductions in other areas.   And, while Bush is certain to come up with his own specifics tobring about some of the ``kinder, gentler nation'' programs hetalked about in his campaign, Reagan's budget appears to open the
Received from server -->way for such changes.   Rather than calling for wholesale elimination of agencies andprograms, as past Reagan budgets have done, the new plan was
Received from server -->expected to be more selective, singling out specific programs and
Received from server -->spending items instead.   That will make it easier for Bush to shape his own budget outline
Received from server -->by offering amendments to the Reagan plan.   And some of Bush's pet campaign themes, including more funds foreducation, were already contained in the Reagan proposal.   ``There's no question, his (Bush's) first test of leadership will
Received from server -->be on this issue,'' Rep. Leon E. Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of theHouse Budget Committee, said.
Received from server -->   ``The real question will not be the news in the Reagan budget,
Received from server -->but how the new president responds to the challenges contained inthe Reagan budget,'' Panetta said in an interview.
Received from server -->   Bush and his lieutenants have maintained a low profile in thepreparation of the Reagan budget. However, his choice for budgetdirector, Richard G. Darman, has made frequent trips to Capitol Hillto meet with Republican budget writers.
Received from server -->   In the meetings, Darman indicated the forthcoming Bush proposalswould be general, and that the incoming president would put greateremphasis on negotiations with Congress, according to participants.
Received from server -->   Bush has said he would send his budget negotiating team, headed
Received from server -->by Darman, to meet with congressional leaders at the outset of his
Received from server -->presidency.   Darman was kept closely informed on details of the preparation of
Received from server -->the final Reagan budget. And Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady _ a
Received from server -->close Bush confidant whom the vice president has announced he willretain _ also played a role in shaping it.   Wright, the outgoing Reagan budget director, said in an interview
Received from server -->on Sunday that the Reagan budget ``satisfies two requirements very
Received from server -->well.''   ``It is President Reagan's last budget,'' he said. ``It is a
Received from server -->responsible, conservative budget. But it has also been put through a
Received from server -->reasonable test. If President-elect Bush wants to use it that way,it provides him with a good base to begin negotiations with Congressduring a very tough year.''</TEXT></DOC><DOC>

A federal jurydecided after a 22-day trial in 1985 that Bendectin did not causebirth defects when taken in prescribed doses.   The case was tried in Ohio because Merrell Dow has its
Received from server -->headquarters in Hamilton County there.   The families that sued said they were denied a fair trial in partbecause the presiding judge barred children under 10 and all
Received from server -->children with visible deformities from attending the trial. Thejudge said allowing the young children and deformed children to
Received from server -->attend could inflame the jury and prejudice the case against Merrell
Received from server -->Dow.   Those children were permitted to watch the trial onclosed-circuit television elsewhere in the court building.   Also, the trial judge limited the trial's focus to determining
Received from server -->whether the families could prove that Bendectin causes birth defects.   Only if the families were successful on that issue _ and theywere not _ would they then have had the opportunity at subsequenttrials to show that Merrell Dow was legally responsible for the
Received from server -->defects and to establish how much money the company must pay.
Received from server -->   The families said splitting up the issues in this manner unfairly
Received from server -->prevented them from presenting evidence that Merrell Dow wasnegligent, guilty of fraud, failed to warn mothers of the drug'sdangers and violated a federal law on branding of drugs.
Received from server -->   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last August that thetrial judge did not act improperly in imposing the restrictions.
Received from server -->   The appeals court rejected arguments that splitting up the trialand barring young children and those with deformities from attending
Received from server -->created a ``sterile atmosphere'' that was unfair to the plaintiffs.   ``Sterility is not necessarily the inevitableconsequence...merely because the jury may not hear the full evidenceof defendant's alleged wrongdoing,'' the appeals court said.

Received from server --><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today turned away argumentsthat judges violate free-speech rights when keeping secret the names
Received from server -->of people selected as grand jury members.   The justices, without comment, let stand a Missouri judge'sdecision to bar public inspection of the names of grand jurors in adouble-murder investigation.
Received from server -->   St. Charles County Judge Lester W. Duggan convened a grand jurylast June to investigate James H. Williams Sr. and his wife, JoAnn
Received from server -->Williams.   The couple was accused in the murder of Walter Scott, Mrs.
Received from server -->Williams' first husband.
Received from server -->   Williams also was accused of killing his ex-wife, Sharon Williams.   After a reporter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch asked for the
Received from server -->names of the grand jury members, Duggan ordered the names be keptconfidential ``in the interest of the safety and welfare'' of eachgrand juror.
Received from server -->   The Pulitzer Publishing Co., which owns the newspaper, sought toforce Duggan to release the names but a state appeals court voted,2-1, to uphold his orders.   The Missouri Supreme Court turned down the newspaper's appeal
Received from server -->last Sept. 13.
Received from server -->   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the Post-Dispatchargued that ``access to the names of those serving on the grand jury
Received from server -->should be presumed open.''   They said any judge should be required to explain the special
Received from server -->circumstances existing before the presumption of openness could beoverriden.
Received from server -->   A practice of keeping the names of grand jury members secret``may lead to the erosion of public confidence in both state andfederal grand juries,'' the appeal said.
Received from server -->   Past Supreme Court rulings, relying on the ``historical
Received from server -->openness'' of court proceedings and the free-speech guarantees of
Received from server -->the Constitution's First Amendment, have recognized the public'sright to attend criminal trials, including jury selection andpretrial hearings.
Received from server -->   The newspaper's appeal said those decisions should be extended toinclude access to grand jurors' names.   But St. Charles County prosecutors urged the justices to reject
Received from server -->the Post-Dispatch's appeal.   They drew a distinction between open trials and traditionallyclosed grand jury proceedings, saying the latter ``are not subjectto the same rigid procedural safeguards.''   The previously most recent grand jury in St. Charles County hadbeen convened in 1978, and names of grand jurors were made publicthen.   But county prosecutors said the 1978 grand jury was investigatingthe purchase and renovation of a building, not ``a highlypublicized, gruesome double homicide.''   ``Public policy dictates that jurors investigating a doublehomicide would reasonably require a greater level of protection ...
Received from server -->from possible reprisals or pressure,'' the prosecutors said.   The case is Pulitzer Publishing Co. vs. Duggan, 88-770.</TEXT>

Received from server -->   Ellis had said that church groups were threatening to boycott thetheater if it showed the movie, directed by Alan Parker and starring
Received from server -->Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe.   On June 21, 1964, civil rights workers James Earl Chaney, 21, whowas black, and whites Andrew Goodman, 20, and Michael Schwerner, 24,disappeared after they were released from jail in Philadelphia. They

Received from server -->   Ellis, who earlier this week said she hadn't made up her mindabout showing the film, said Sunday she reached a decision againstthe movie after after discussing it with her son Shelly Steiger, thetheater manager.
Received from server -->   The movie has refocused national attention on this town of 6,800people, which is 70 miles northwest of Jackson. The film has beenreleased in five cities and is scheduled for nationwide release

Received from server -->   During most movies at Ellis' cinema, blacks customarily sit in
Received from server -->the balcony, with whites, a few blacks and Choctaw Indians sit downin the orchestra seats. Steiger said this was by custom and was notrequired by the theater management.   Other theaters in Mississippi will run the movie.   Monte Royal, owner of two cinemas in Meridian, which is about 40

Received from server -->Feb. 10.
Received from server -->   ``Even though the picture is fiction based on a factual incident,

Received from server -->   The Supreme Court today refused to grant acollege professor access to sealed grand jury records in the case ofOwen J. Lattimore, a China scholar accused in the 1950s of being acommunist sympathizer.   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Prof. Robert P.Newman of the University of Pittsburgh, who is writing a Lattimorebiography.
Received from server -->   Lattimore, 88, and now retired in Pawtucket, R.I., was accused by
Received from server -->the late Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, R-Wis., of helping to ``loseChina'' to the communists.   A professor at Johns Hopkins University in the 1950s and an
Received from server -->expert in Asian affairs, Lattimore was indicted on perjury chargesby a federal grand jury after the Justice Department accused him of
Received from server -->lying to a congressional committee.
Received from server -->   Before that committee, he had denied ever being a communist agent
Received from server -->or sympathizer.   Parts of the government's case were declared unconstitutional in1952, and again in 1955 a judge threw out another indictment. Thegovernment then dropped Lattimore's prosecution.
Received from server -->   Public Citizen, an organization representing Newman, said thegrand jury records could provide valuable insights into the McCarthyera.
Received from server -->   ``The Lattimore indictments call into question the extent towhich unchecked prosecutorial power and congressional influence may
Received from server -->have been used to engineer a political prosecution and to employ thegrand jury for improper purposes,'' lawyers for Public Citizen said.   Newman said the public has an important interest in beinginformed about what happened in the grand jury probe.   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last April that
Received from server -->the rule for preserving grand jury secrecy ``makes no provision for
Received from server -->disclosure of transcripts to a private party for historical researchpurposes.''   Newman and Public Citizen said the ruling ``places critical
Received from server -->information about historically important chapters of history offlimits to historians and the public.''
Received from server -->   They said other courts have allowed public disclosure of grandjury testimony when it is in the public interest even if federal
Received from server -->rules do not authorize specifically opening the files to help
Received from server -->historians.   The Reagan administration urged the Supreme Court to rejectNewman's appeal.
Received from server -->   ``Even if dressed up as a significant project of historicalscholarship, requests of (this) type...could not easily bedistinguished from journalistic inquiries into subjects of publicinterest or requests based simply on individual or public
Received from server -->curiosity,'' the Justice Department said.

Received from server -->   The Supreme Court today refused to barcity-owned water systems from charging some non-resident customers
Received from server -->higher rates than other non-residents even if there is nocost-related reason.
Received from server -->   The court, without comment, turned down an appeal by Summit
Received from server -->County, Ohio, officials who said they are being charged unfair ratesby Akron, Ohio.
Received from server -->   The case began in 1981 when Akron officials sued Summit County
Received from server -->for allegedly breaking a 1979 contract between the two governmentalbodies. The city said the county illegally wittheld payment forwater supplied by the city.   The county countersued, claiming it entered into the contract

Received from server -->than another Akron water customer in the area, the neighboring city

Received from server -->   The Ohio Supreme Court upheld the higher rates for Summit County,ruling county officials signed a contract with the city they must

Received from server -->cost of supplying it is no greater than in providing water forTallmadge.
Received from server -->   ``Where rates for water from a municipally owned public utilityare set forth in a contract, such rates will not be struck down asdiscriminatory even where no factor exists which could justify the

Received from server --><TEXT>   The Reagan administration today proposed
Received from server -->eliminating two dozen federal education programs while slightlyincreasing overall education outlays from $20.6 billion this year to
Received from server -->$21.2 billion in fiscal 1990.
Received from server -->   Some $541 million saved by the cuts, plus another $212 million
Received from server -->from cost savings officials hope to achieve from the guaranteedstudent loan program, would go to expand existing programs for
Received from server -->disadvantaged students from kindergarten to graduate school.   The proposed budget does not incorporate any of the education
Received from server -->spending ideas set forth during President-elect Bush's campaign.They included a $500 million merit schools program for schoolsserving disadvantaged children and a $50 million infusion for a
Received from server -->magnet schools program designed to encourage parental choice.   But Bush, who pledged during the campaign to be ``the education
Received from server -->president,'' is expected to rework the budget in the weeks followinghis Jan. 20 inauguration. The education community asserted last week
Received from server -->that he needs to request an extra $2.5 billion for fiscal 1990 inorder to begin to fulfill his pledge.
Received from server -->   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said last month that ``I did
Received from server -->the best I could'' to secure the best possible budget for hisdepartment.
Received from server -->   The document does not contain specific new initiatives reflectinghis own priorities _ cutting illiteracy and the dropout rate _ but
Received from server -->that could come later. Cavazos has said that after Bush takes over,``We will be getting into some rather specific kinds of programs.''
Received from server -->   Among the programs on the chopping block under the Reagan plan
Received from server -->are the Women's Educational Equity Act research program, whichofficials complain has outlived its purpose, and a two-year dropout
Received from server -->prevention demonstration project due to expire.   Also suggested for extinction are programs the administration
Received from server -->considers duplicative, and programs officials say should be financed
Received from server -->by the private sector. The latter include impact aid to schooldistricts serving areas with tax-exempt federal installations; Star
Received from server -->Schools, which would put satellite technology in schools; and anumber of scholarship and fellowship programs.
Received from server -->   The largest dollar increase under the Reagan plan _ and one ofthe only boosts higher than the anticipated 3.4 percent inflation
Received from server -->rate _ would go to Pell grants, the chief federal assistance program
Received from server -->for low-income post-secondary students.   Current budget authority for the program is nearly $4.5 billion.
Received from server -->That would rise by $256 million under the Reagan plan _ a 5.7
Received from server -->percent hike. The maximum grant amount of $2,300 would stay the same
Received from server -->and the number of students receiving aid would rise 46,000 to 3.1million.
Received from server -->   Reagan would increase outlays for Chapter 1, the major federal
Received from server -->program for low-achieving children in poor neighborhoods, from the
Received from server -->current $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion in fiscal 1990. Most of theextra money would be for grants funneled to areas with the highest
Received from server -->concentrations of needy students.
Received from server -->   The Reagan budget would hike spending authority for vocational
Received from server -->and bilingual education programs by about 3.4 percent. Spending
Received from server -->authority for vocational education would rise to $949 million whilebilingual would increase to $157 million. Outlays are anticipated to
Received from server -->be slightly less.   The administration is hoping to save $212 million on theguaranteed student loan program by reducing special allowance
Received from server -->payments used as an incentive to lenders to participate, and byreducing guaranteed reinsurance to lenders and state guarantoragencies from 100 percent to 90 percent on the dollar. Congresswould have to approve both moves.
Received from server -->   The entitlement program currently costs the government about $3.2billion in interest and default payments. Officials expect loan
Received from server -->volume to rise from $11.5 billion this year to $12.5 billion infiscal 1990, adding another 278,000 students to the 4 million-plusalready participating in the program.

Received from server --><DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Archdiocese of Detroit softened a proposal to
Received from server -->close or merge 48 city parishes, but Cardinal Edmund Szoka said morethan a quarter of the city's 112 parishes still would close by June
Received from server -->30.
Received from server -->   Szoka announced Sunday that 30 mostly inner-city churches wouldbe closed, while an additional 25 parishes would be given a year toprove their viability. In September, a task force had recommended
Received from server -->that 43 churches be closed and five others merged into parishes withmore members and greater resources.
Received from server -->   Even with the reduced number of parishes involved, there is noprecedent in the U.S. Roman Catholic church for such large-scale
Received from server -->closings, Msgr. John Tracy Ellis, a historian at the Catholic
Received from server -->University of America in Washington, said today.
Received from server -->   ``The situation was entirely different in the past,'' he said.
Received from server -->``It was a question of how many new parishes to open, not to close.Insofar as I can recall, there is nothing like this.''   The church closings were necessary, officials said, because of a
Received from server -->white flight from the city that reduced Detroit's Catholic
Received from server -->population from 100,000 housholds in 1976 to fewer than 50,000 today.
Received from server -->   ``The church, especially the church in the city of Detroit, findsitself in much different circumstances in 1989 than those that
Received from server -->existed in '69, or '59, or '29, or 1909,'' Szoka said. ``It cannotact as though nothing has changed.''
Received from server -->   Szoka, who had defended the earlier church closing plan, saidSunday the 25 churches whose survival is in doubt would be asked to
Received from server -->increase membership, services and parish staff.   ``All we are ask is that they try. ... I mention to them that in
Received from server -->no way is there a Damocles (sword) hanging over their head,'' hesaid. ``It is meant rather to be a stimulus.''
Received from server -->   The cardinal called for more blacks to enter religious life in
Received from server -->his announcement Sunday and said he also intended the closings to
Received from server -->help end a ``plantation mentality,'' with white parish leadersrunning churches attended largely by blacks.
Received from server -->   One of the 30 closing churches is expected to become a blackCatholic historical museum, he said.
Received from server -->   The announcement in September resulted in a wave of protestagainst the 1.5 million-member archdiocese, which takes in six
Received from server -->counties in the Detroit area. There are an estimated 50,000 to60,000 black Catholics in the archdiocese, church officials said.
Received from server -->   On Sunday, at Our Lady of the Rosary, one of many churches that
Received from server -->appealed the closing plan, parishioners were elated at the one-year
Received from server -->reprieve.
Received from server -->   ``There's a year and a pronouncement by the archdiocese to workwith parishes to see some sort of improvement,'' said Patrick
Received from server -->Gossman, a member of Our Lady of the Rosary. ``We'll go on with a
Received from server -->certain sense of hope and work at it.''   But there was bitterness at churches slated to close.   At St. Philip Neri, sniffling could be heard among the 70 peopleattending Mass as the Rev. Donald Walker announced that the east
Received from server -->side church would close.   ``This wasn't supposed to happen,'' Walker said, referring to thedifficulty he had in making the announcement. ``I guess you just
Received from server -->resent it when someone comes in and tells you it's time to die.''</TEXT></DOC><DOC><DOCNO> AP890109-0083 </DOCNO><FILEID>AP-NR-01-09-89 1127EST</FILEID>

Received from server -->after the search ended. ``That's the key to any search.''   Searchers braved 20-degree weather and gusty winds to sift
Received from server -->through a half-mile area near here for remnants of theKansas-Pacific locomotive.   The engine, 19 cars and a caboose fell 30 feet from a railroad
Received from server -->bridge in 1878, when a flood struck the area 30 miles east ofDenver. Twelve of the cars and the locomotive were reported to havebeen buried in the sand.
Received from server -->   Some researchers believe that the railroad subsequently salvagedthe expensive engine, but Cussler and his band of searchers are
Received from server -->still hoping it's still in the ground. The group hopes to squeeze in
Received from server -->one more weekend of hunting before spring to search a two-mile areadownstream from the original bridge.   ``We know it's here and we will be back,'' Dirgo said.   Volunteer Eric Walker of Darwin, Australia, found a part from arailroad flat car. Others found slag and coal, which officials saidmay have been used for ballast by the railroad.
Received from server -->   Cussler said if the locomotive is found, it will belong to thelandowner. Mike Pinzenscham, who watched the dig's progress with his8-year-old son, Justin, said his family has owned the land for about
Received from server -->25 years.   Through the Arvada-based agency, Cussler, the author of ``Raise
Received from server -->the Titanic,'' has located 54 sunken vessels including a dirigible.But this is his first buried train hunt.   The agency's next project will be a search for the steamship New
Received from server -->Orleans, which was built by Robert Fulton in 1811. Cussler said theship's bottom was torn out when it ran aground on a stump in theMississippi River at Baton Rouge, La.

Received from server -->said Ghana's charge d'affaires, Kwadwo Kwakye. ``We want (him) to bereleased.''
Received from server -->   Alex Dosoo of Ghana, a student at Hehai University in eastern

Received from server -->   Police gave two other African students from Gambia and Benin 15

Received from server -->   Xinhua, the official news agency, said Nsubuga David Mugwanya,26, had been depressed about financial problems and examinationfailures.
Received from server -->   The clash between African students and Chinese school workers andstudents began when the Africans brought Chinese women to a dance
Received from server -->Dec. 24.   Kwakye said the fight ``happened on a campus and should have beenhandled by the university and not handed over to the police.''   In a telephone interview, he said he did not think Dosoo should
Received from server -->face criminal charges.
Received from server -->   He said authorities took three days to inform the embassy ofDosoo's arrest and still have not advised them of any formal chargesor what punishment the student might face.   ``We have protested his detention and the fact that we were not

Received from server -->   Kwakye said he told Ghanaian students today that ``it was withintheir rights'' to boycott, ``but that they must be careful not to
Received from server -->contravene the law.''   The official Xinhua News Agency quoted other diplomats as saying
Received from server -->they plan to advise their students to return to classes and obey thelaw. The approximately 140 African students in Nanking have not

Received from server -->boycotting students to return to class. Liu said Chinese students atthe school were wrong to protest last week, but that the class
Received from server -->boycott also was ``erroneous.''   Ghana is the only African country that has said it is considering

Received from server --><TEXT>   President Reagan today asked Congress toincrease spending on AIDS research by 24 percent and trim the growthof the huge Medicare and Medicaid health programs by cutting
Received from server -->payments to states and fees to hospitals and physicians.   Overall, the proposed fiscal 1990 budget for the Department ofHealth and Human Services would increase 5.7 percent to $424.4billion in fiscal 1990.   The department is the largest Cabinet agency in terms ofspending, accounting for 37 percent of federal outlays, including an
Received from server -->anticipated $257 billion on Social Security for the next fiscal yearbeginning Oct. 1.   The budget proposal would add $311 million to the fight against
Received from server -->the spread of the deadly acquired immune deficiency syndrome, ``ourhighest public health priority.'' The increase would raise spendingfor research, education and prevention of the disease to $1.6billion.   The department estimates another $925 million will be spent on
Received from server -->treatment and income support to AIDS victims through Medicaid,
Received from server -->Medicare, Disability Insurance and other service programs.   The overwhelming bulk of the department's spending is earmarked
Received from server -->for entitlements _ Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid _ over
Received from server -->which the agency has little budget control since eligibility for the
Received from server -->programs is set by Congress.   If no changes were made, Medicare _ which pays for the healthcare of about 34 million elderly and disabled Americans _ would growby 14 percent in fiscal 1990.
Received from server -->   However, Reagan proposes trimming that growth rate to 10 percentby cutting $3.5 billion from fees paid to physicians and hospitals.His Medicare budget would total $94.9 billion.   About a third of the Medicare cut, $1 billion, would come from
Received from server -->reducing the additional disbursements that teach hospitals receiveto cover their costs of training interns and residents.
Received from server -->   Other reductions would be made in payments to hospitals forcapital costs and fees to physicians for certain procedures,including radiology, anesthesiology and surgery, under the Medicarepayments system.   A new part of Medicare is the Catastrophic Health Insuranceprogram, which is intended to be entirely self-supporting. It is
Received from server -->financed by premiums paid by Medicare recipients, which areprojected to total about $8.6 billion in fiscal 1990. But the
Received from server -->program is projected to spend only $4 billion that year.
Received from server -->   Medicaid _ the program that provides health care for about 26
Received from server -->million low-income Americans _ would grow about 9 percent next yearif unchanged. The administration, however, is proposing to slice thegrowth to 5 percent growth or by about $1.4 billion to a spending atotal of $36 billion.   Much of the reduction would come from reducing payments to the
Received from server -->states, which administer the program under federal guidelines, byabout $1.1 billion.   Benefits under the Social Security program are protected andrecipients. Based on administration estimates of what inflation will
Received from server -->be this year, the budget projects Social Security recipients gettinga 3.6 percent cost-of-living increase in their benefits in January1990.</TEXT>

Received from server --><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court, acting in an appeal urgingreversal of its landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortionnationwide, today agreed to review a Missouri law regulatingabortions.   The justices said they will study a federal appeals court rulingthat struck down key provisions of the state law.   Even before today's action in the appeal filed by Missouri
Received from server -->officials, the case had become the most-watched battleground in the
Received from server -->continuing political war over abortion. Justice Department lawyersalso are urging the high court to use the case as a means of undoing
Received from server -->its 1973 ruling, called Roe vs. Wade.   But nothing in the brief order issued today suggested that thejustices will reconsider Roe vs. Wade.
Received from server -->   The court's eventual decision, expected by July, could resolvethe Missouri controversy without significantly changing the 1973
Received from server -->decision or other past rulings on abortion.
Received from server -->   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last July 13 struck down,
Received from server -->among other aspects of the Missouri abortion law, these fiveprovisions:
Received from server -->   _A ban on using public hospitals or other government-runfacilities for abortions not necessary to save a woman's life.
Received from server -->   _A ban prohibiting any public employee from performing orassisting an abortion.   _A ban on using taxpayer money for ``encouraging or counseling''women to have abortions.
Received from server -->   _A requirement that doctors planning to abort a fetus believed tobe older than 19 weeks test for weight and lung capacity todetermine whether the fetus is capable of surviving outside the womb.
Received from server -->   _A declaration that ``the life of each human being begins atconception.''   The appeals court upheld a provision in the state law that bans
Received from server -->the use of taxpayer money for performing or assisting an abortion.But it said use of a public facility or the services of a publicemployee cannot be banned if all such costs are reimbursed by a
Received from server -->patient.   In the apppeal acted on today, Missouri Attorney General William
Received from server -->L. Webster said the 8th Circuit court's ruling ``expands (SupremeCourt) precedents in favor of abortion on demand, further contracts
Received from server -->the state's compelling interest in the life of viable, unbornchildren and disregards this court's holdings that abortion is aprivate matter which government need in no way subsidize.''
Received from server -->   The 1973 decision ``should itself be reconsidered'' if it cannotbe squared with the disputed Missouri law, Webster said.
Received from server -->   William Bradford Reynolds, then chief of the Justice Department'scivil rights division, wrote to Missouri officials last summerurging them to include a challenge of Roe vs. Wade in the state's
Received from server -->appeal.   ``I felt this was the best case on the horizon to undertake
Received from server -->reconsideration of Roe,'' Reynolds told The Wall Street Journal in arecent interview.
Received from server -->   In a brief filed two days after the presidential election astNov. 8, Justice Department lawyers supported Missouri's appeal.   That sparked Molly Yard, president of the National Organization
Received from server -->for Women, to accuse the Justice Department of ``declaring war onthe women of this country.''   Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority,
Received from server -->said there will be ``no honeymoon on the issue of abortion'' forPresident-elect Bush because of the Justice Department's involvementin the Missouri case.   In its 1973 ruling, the Supreme Court said women have a
Received from server -->constitutional right of abortion, based on the right of privacy. Thecourt most recently reaffirmed that ruling in 1983.
Received from server -->   Today's court is viewed as deeply divided on the abortion issue.
Received from server -->   Justice Harry A. Blackmun told a law school audience lastSeptember that the 1973 decision he authored could be overturned inthe court's 1988-89 term.   ``The next question is, `Will Roe vs. Wade go down the drain?' I
Received from server -->think there's a very distinct possibility that it will _ this term.You can count the votes,'' he said.
Received from server -->   While Blackmun and Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall
Received from server -->and John Paul Stevens have resisted attempts to reverse or greatlymodify the 1973 decision, anti-abortion forces are hoping some dayto attract five votes for such a result.
Received from server -->   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Byron R. Whitedissented from the 1973 ruling and several subsequent abortiondecisions.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in past decisions has questioned the
Received from server -->court's reasoning in its 1973 decision.   Justice Antonin Scalia, who has not yet voted in an abortiondecision since being named to the high court by President Reagan in1986, is thought to favor overturning or curtailing Roe vs. Wade.   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court last Feb. 18,likewise has not voted in an abortion decision. His views onabortion and the Roe vs. Wade decision are not known in anysignificant detail.
Received from server -->   In other action today, the court:   _ Agreed to decide whether Congress may outlaw all sexuallyexplicit telephone dial-up message services, dubbed ``dial-a-porn.''   The justices will judge, sometime by July, the validity of a 1988law that sought to ban all obscene and indecent messages availablethrough dial-a-porn services.   _ Allowed criminal defendants to exclude potential jurors becauseof their race.
Received from server -->   In a case involving a black man's murder by Ku Klux Klan members,rejected arguments by Alabama prosecutors _ supported by lawenforcement officials nationwide _ that defense lawyers unlawfully
Received from server -->are seeking to impanel an all-white jury in the Klan case.   _ Refused to review lawsuits seeking millions of dollars indamages in behalf of children with birth defects allegedly caused bythe anti-nausea drug Bendectin.

Received from server -->caseworkers and supervisors who help administer the state'sfederally funded foster care program in Baltimore.
Received from server -->   They were sued by children who say they were victims of physicaland sexual abuse and medical neglect.   A federal judge ordered officials to submit a plan for improving
Received from server -->conditions in foster homes, and for at least monthly monitoring of
Received from server -->the placement of children in the homes.   The judge also required the officials to improve medical services
Received from server -->for foster children and to report instances of poor medical care tothe children's attorneys.
Received from server -->   The judge also ruled that social workers who place or keep
Received from server -->children in foster homes are not entitled to immunity from lawsuits
Received from server -->in such cases.
Received from server -->   The 4th Circuit court upheld the decision in February 1988.   The appeals court rejected the social workers' claims that afederal law providing funds for foster care created no duty on theirpart to know whether a child would be exposed to mistreatment orabuse.
Received from server -->   The appeals court said the social workers' right to claim
Received from server -->immunity from suit must be based on more than their own belief thatthey acted properly. It is up to a trial court examining the factsto decide whether the social workers permitted mistreatment, theappeals court said.   The National Association of Social Workers, in supporting the
Received from server -->appeal by the Maryland employees, said the 4th Circuit court rulingplaces social workers at risk for alleged abuses that occurreddecades earlier.   ``No professional consensus exists even now'' on how to assurefoster children will not be harmed, the association said.
Received from server -->``Maltreatment of children in foster homes often is difficult, andat times impossible, to prevent by even a very highly skilled andwell-trained social worker.''   The Supreme Court already is studying a related issue in the caseof a Wisconsin boy who suffered severe beatings by his father.   In that case, the justices are expected to decide whether public
Received from server -->officials may be sued when their alleged gross negligence permits achild to be abused by a parent.   Social workers were accused of failing to come to the aid of theboy even after they had evidence that he was beaten repeatedly.
Received from server -->   The case acted on today focuses on whether a federal civil rightslaw enacted after the Civil War permits damage suits based onalleged violations of a 1980 law, the Adoption Assistance and ChildWelfare Act.   The 1980 law requires states to meet certain conditions beforereceiving federal funds for foster care. The 4th Circuit court said
Received from server -->the 1980 law creates a basis for private citizens to sue if thoseconditions allegedly are not met.   The case is Massinga vs. L.J., 87-1796.</TEXT></DOC><DOC><DOCNO> AP890109-0095 </DOCNO>

Received from server --><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci is askingCongress to increase defense spending by 2 percent above the rate ofinflation for the next two years in a proposed military budgetlikely to change after George Bush becomes president.
Received from server -->   In proposing $315.2 billion in budget authority for 1990, and$330.89 billion for 1991, Carlucci is requesting an increase in StarWars spending authority from $4.1 billion in 1989 to $5.9 billion in1990 and $7 billion in 1991.   Under the proposed defense budget for the fiscal year beginningnext Oct. 1, although $315.2 billion would be authorized, $303
Received from server -->billion would actually be spent. The spending authority includesfunding for long-term projects and weapons buying in future years.The lower figure, outlays, includes only the funds to be spentduring the 12 months of the 1990 fiscal year.   The $303 billion in 1990 outlays includes Pentagon spending and$9.2 billion for Energy Department nuclear weapons and research
Received from server -->programs, and is projected at $4.7 billion above actual spendingduring this fiscal year.   Among the requests likely to be changed by Congress or Bush are$94.6 million in spending authority in 1990 and $124.3 million thenext year for research on a new Navy Anti-Satellite (ASAT) weapon;and elimination of a proposed single-warhead intercontinentalballistic missile, the Midgetman.   In other areas of national security, the Reagan administration isasking for an increase of $5.6 billion, to a level of $8.4 billion,in security assistance programs to other nations. The whopping 200percent jump comes in part because loan repayments from othernations go down next year.   The administration is asking for $3.8 billion for grants to
Received from server -->foreign countries _ mostly in the Middle East _ so they can buy U.S.weapons.   Another $3.5 billion is being sought in non-military aid, mostlyfor Central America and the Middle East. The budget messageforecasts the request of additional money for the Contra guerrillasof Nicaragua.
Received from server -->   The proposed Pentagon budget also continues production of thenewly unveiled B-2 or stealth bomber, designed to elude enemy radar.The exact annual cost of that program remains classified, althoughthe Air Force announced Dec. 16 that each B-2 would cost $516million, a total of $68.1 billion for 132 planes by 1995, making it
Received from server -->the most expensive plane in the world.   The B-2 program may face trouble following disclosures ofinadequacies in electronic equipment designed to enable newlyacquired B-1B bombers to penetrate enemy defenses.   It is also far from clear whether Bush and Congress will agree to
Received from server -->cancel the Midgetman, which would be designed to be fired frommobile trucks. Last year, the Air Force volunteered to drop theMidgetman in favor of a rail-mobile version of the 10-warhead MX, orPeacekeeper.   The Air Force argued that 500 warheads could be deployed on 50Peacekeepers for $10 billion vs. $44.7 billion for the Midgetman.
Received from server -->   But Congress restored money for research on Midgetman, arguingthat more missiles would be harder to track and destroy, and that asingle-warhead weapon made more sense under a proposed StrategicArms Limitation Treaty limiting the number of launchers.   Bush was expected to submit a revised version of the budget, and
Received from server -->the retired Air Force general he has named as national security
Received from server -->adviser, Brent Scowcroft, has publicly endorsed the Midgetman overthe MX and has suggested lower levels of funding for Star Wars,formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative.   The active duty strength of the armed forces would increase by5,000 in 1990 to a level of 2,138,300, then decrease the following
Received from server -->year to 2,134,600.   The force level in the Army and Marine Corps remain the same, at772,000 for the Army and 197,000 for the Marines, that of the AirForce would decline slightly, from 571,000 in 1989 and 1990 to
Received from server -->567,000 in 1991, and that of the Navy would grow from 593,000 to
Received from server -->598,000 to provide crews for the addition of new aircraft carriersto the current fleet of 13 flattops.   The Navy must postpone its plans for a 600-ship fleet, althoughAdm. Stephen Loftus told reporters that goal could be achievedsometime in the 1990s. The number of ships would drop to 574 next
Received from server -->year and 571 in 1991 with retirements that include two ballisticmissiles submarines and the conversion of another into a moored
Received from server -->training ship in 1990.
Received from server -->   One submarine armed with Trident class ballistic missiles is tobe added each year, with 63 Trident II missiles delivered in 1990
Received from server -->and 52 in 1991.
Received from server -->   The Navy, as expected, will acquire two SSN-688 nuclear attacksubmarines in 1990 and two SSN-21 Seawolf nuclear attack submarinesin 1991.
Received from server -->   The budget calls for pay raises of 3.6 percent in 1990 and 3.2percent in 1991 for uniformed military and of 2 percent and 3
Received from server -->percent for civilian employees of the Defense Department.   As the number of men and women in active service declines, the
Received from server -->number in the National Guard and reserves is to increase by 7,600 to1,178,300 in fiscal 1990 and to 1,181,700 the following year.</TEXT>

Received from server --></TEXT><NOTE>SUMMARY</NOTE>
Received from server --><TEXT>   Reagan's farewell budget proposes collecting $1.059 trillion in

Received from server --><NOTE>FEES AND TAXES</NOTE><TEXT>
Received from server -->   While proposing no new taxes, the budget seeks $1 billion in avariety of user fees, ranging from a new $25 decal for boat owners
Received from server -->to higher charges for getting government-backed loans, including VAmortgages.
Received from server -->   The president called for a $1.7 billion tax cut for corporationswith foreign operations and recommended changes that would save the
Received from server -->oil and gas industries about $39 million.   Reagan urged repeal of a law requiring that taxes on airplane
Received from server -->tickets, shippers and fuel be cut in half next Jan. 1, a move whichwould cost shippers and travelers $1.2 billion.
Received from server -->   He would also require all state and local government workers topay the tax that funds Medicare. Those hired before April 1, 1986,
Received from server -->are not paying, even though most are eligible for Medicare becauseof earlier, non-government employment or through their spouses. Thiswould raise $2 billion.

Received from server --><TEXT>   The budget proposes trimming Medicare, which provides health care
Received from server -->to Social Security recipients, by $3.2 billion below the projectedincrease for 1990, primarily by reducing the fees received by
Received from server -->doctors and hospitals.   Medicaid, which pays the health bills of poor people, would be
Received from server -->cut by $1.7 billion over its projected increase for 1990 with thesavings coming from reductions in federal payments to the states,
Received from server -->which run the Medicaid program.
Received from server -->   An increase of 24 percent to $1.6 billion is proposed in thesearch for a cure for AIDS.</TEXT>
Received from server --><NOTE>DEFENSE</NOTE><TEXT>
Received from server -->   There would be $303 billion in defense outlays, includingPentagon spending and $9.2 billion for Energy Department nuclear

Received from server -->   Fourteen years after passage of the Congressional Budget Act andthree years after enactment of the Balanced Budget and Emergency

Received from server -->they deserve it.   Under the Congressional Budget Act, congressional budget
Received from server -->resolutions _ Congress' proposed budgets _ are passed each year.
Received from server -->   They are not sent to the president for approval and, therefore,are not law.   They provide guidance to the committees of Congress, but the
Received from server -->guidance is often late and ambiguous.   The resolutions are usually passed well after the dates required

Received from server -->   Moreover, there is little agreement within Congress on theguidance provided.
Received from server -->   The House of Representatives and the Senate do not agree, exceptin the most general terms, on the priorities implied by resolutionsboth have approved.

Received from server -->   The Supreme Court today agreed to use the case
Received from server -->of a convicted murderer from Missouri to study double-jeopardy
Received from server -->protection for criminal defendants.
Received from server -->   The court agreed to hear arguments by state officials seeking toreinstate a life prison sentence for Larry P. Thomas.
Received from server -->   Thomas was convicted of murder and attempted robbery in an
Received from server -->attempted holdup of an auto parts store in St. Louis on Nov. 8, 1972.   Mentoe Vernell, a customer at the store, died in a shootout withThomas.   Thomas was sentenced to 15 years in prison for attempted robberyand a life term for murder.
Received from server -->   Then-Gov. Christopher Bond of Missouri commuted the robberysentence in 1981 after Thomas had served about eight years. Heremained in prison on the murder conviction.   A state court subsequently threw out the sentence for attemptedrobbery and credited the time Thomas had served for that crime tothe murder sentence. The state courts said he must continue servingthe life sentence.
Received from server -->   Thomas then appealed in federal court to have the murder sentence
Received from server -->thrown out.   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 5-4 ruling lastApril, ruled that Thomas' right against double jeopardy was violated
Received from server -->because he was given multiple sentences for the same crime. The
Received from server -->governor's commutation means that Thomas legally had served one ofhis sentences and must be set free, the appeals court said.   ``We hold that Thomas had legally satisfied the 15-year sentencefor the attempted robbery and that his continued confinement for the
Received from server -->felony murder offense violated his double jeopardy rights,'' theappeals court said.   State officials, in appealing to the Supreme Court, said the
Received from server -->appeals court exceeded its authority and misinterpreted Missouri law.   The state attorney general's office said the state courts``cured'' the double jeopardy violation when it threw out thesentence for attempted robbery and gave Thomas credit for timeserved.

Received from server -->said U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela, upon issuing the order sought
Received from server -->by attorneys fighting the rule.
Received from server -->   Vela set a hearing for 9 a.m. Thursday, when he said he wouldconsider converting the restraining order into an injunction againstthe U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.   Attorney David Ayala, representing the INS, had asked the judgeinstead to delay considering the restraining order until Thursday togive the government a chance to prepare further arguments.   ``Your honor, the Immigration Service is not to blame for theplight of the people who are out there,'' Ayala said.
Received from server -->   The judge's restraining order restores the right of asylumseekers to travel farther into the United States and submit theirapplications in the INS districts where they intend to live.   Hundreds of Central American asylum seekers have set up camp in
Received from server -->the Rio Grande Valley to await the processing of their applications.
Received from server -->Some 300 applicants camping in a field near Brownsville have beenordered to leave the primitive tent city by this afternoon because
Received from server -->it's private property.   Today's ruling doesn't affect the property owner's order, exceptthat the 300 persons in the tent city would be free now to go to
Received from server -->another part of the United States.   The 300 have been sleeping under sheets of plastic supported bytree limbs for the past week in a field across the street from the
Received from server -->Casa Oscar Romero shelter for Central American refugees operated bythe Roman Catholic Church, which is filled to capacity.   The INS policy, which was effective Dec. 16, also had limited the
Received from server -->aliens' ability to work during the waiting period while their asylumapplications were processed, at least 30 days.
Received from server -->   Previously, aliens who entered the country illegally in southern
Received from server -->Texas were allowed to pursue their asylum applications in othercities, often Miami or Los Angeles.
Received from server -->   INS officials say the change was adopted to reduce huge casebacklogs in those cities and curb frivolous refugee claims. The INS
Received from server -->maintains that most of the 300,000 asylum applicants who passed
Received from server -->through the Harlingen District last year were ineligible for
Received from server -->political asylum because they merely wanted to better themselveseconomically.
Received from server -->   The attorneys suing INS Commissioner Alan Nelson and U.S.Attorney General Dick Thornburgh blame the 3-week-old procedure for
Received from server -->an increase in the number of Central Americans sleeping in condemned
Received from server -->buildings and camping with little or no shelter. Their federallawsuit was filed Friday.   ``In essence, south Texas has been turned into a de facto
Received from server -->detention area and asylum applicants are trapped there,'' says thesuit filed on behalf of asylum-seekers by immigration attorney LindaReyna Yanez, Robert Rubin of the San Francisco Lawyers' Committee
Received from server -->for Urban Affairs and the Harlingen-based Proyecto Libertadimmigrant advocacy group.
Received from server -->   It accuses the INS of depriving immigrants of adequate access tothe asylum procedure as required by the Refugee Act of 1980, and ofimplementing a policy change without publishing it in the Federal
Received from server -->Register for public comment.
Received from server -->   INS officials have declined comment on the lawsuit.   Legal officer Susan Timberlake with the United Nations High
Received from server -->Commissioner for Refugees visited the tent city southeast of
Received from server -->Brownsville last Tuesday and said she witnessed ``difficulty andhardship.''   On Sunday, sheriff's deputies told those living on the
Received from server -->litter-strewn campsite that they had 24 hours to vacate the privateproperty or face trespassing charges.
Received from server -->   Cameron County Sheriff Alex Perez said authorities gave the orderto vacate after the property owner posted ``No Trespassing'' signs
Received from server -->in English and Spanish on Sunday afternoon.   ``Maybe I'll sleep in some other field,'' said Gerardo Enrique
Received from server -->Perez, 19, of Honduras, as a rainy cold front blew into the areaSunday night.
Received from server -->   The campers have been helped by area residents who have provide
Received from server -->food and clothing, but the field has no sanitary facilities.
Received from server -->   But some nearby residents said the growing campground made themnervous.   ``You don't know who these people are,'' said Alma Zieger,manager of Paul's RV Park, who said the situation ``creates
Received from server -->uneasiness'' among the retirees making up the bulk of her tenants.</TEXT></DOC><DOC><DOCNO> AP890109-0104 </DOCNO><FILEID>AP-NR-01-09-89 1212EST</FILEID><FIRST>u w BC-BudgetText 12thadd   01-09 0379</FIRST>

Received from server -->   The accomplishments of the American people in the past eight

Received from server -->federal deficit.   Deficit reduction is a key national priority, written into law by
Received from server -->the G-R-H Act, which, despite its defects, legislated a process toachieve a balanced budget.   This budget achieves the 1990 target of the amended act, and
Received from server -->projects a budget balance in 1993.   It preserves legitimate programs for the aged and needy, providesfor adequate national security, devotes more resources to other
Received from server -->high-priority activities, and accomplishes all this without raisingtaxes.
Received from server -->   Tax increases are not needed.   History shows that they would simply be used by the Congress toincrease spending.
Received from server -->   Tax increases have been overwhelmingly voted down in the lastthree presidential elections.   I call upon the Congress to enact this budget.
Received from server -->   Higher taxes are not needed _ as this budget demonstrates _ butgenuine deficit reduction through moderating the growth in spendingis essential to enable the next administration and Congress to
Received from server -->address the nation's agenda for the future.   Over the past eight years, we Americans have made our world asafer place for freedom because we had the will to reinvigorate our
Received from server -->economy, rebuild our defenses, and provide for the less fortunateamong us.   Together, we achieved a new beginning for our country andprepared the way for the next administration to build on our

Received from server --><TEXT>   Both engines on a brand-new Boeing 737
Received from server -->apparently failed before the plane crashed along a highway, killing
Received from server -->46 people, officials said today. Aviation experts said the chances
Received from server -->of double-engine failure were about 10 million to one.
Received from server -->   ``So far the evidence, although by no means conclusive, isconsistent with the right engine having stopped before impact and
Received from server -->there are also signs of fire in the left engine,'' Transport
Received from server -->Minister Paul Channon said in an interview on British BroadcastingCorp. television.
Received from server -->   Olivier Fagard, a spokesman for the company that makes the CFM-56
Received from server -->engines the jet used, told The Associated Press, ``It is extremelyimprobable that both motors would break down in such a short
Received from server -->interval.''   ``We have very impressive reliability statistics,'' said Fagard,
Received from server -->of the French company SNECMA, which builds the engines in consortiumwith General Electric Co. ```We don't know. It has been establishedthat there was no fire in second motor. But we don't know any more
Received from server -->than that,'' he said.   Officials raised the number of confirmed dead to 46 late today.Eighty people were injured.   Investigators recovered the flight recorders from the wreckage,
Received from server -->and firefighters pumped foam onto the crumpled jet to preventseeping aviation fuel from catching fire.   The Belfast-bound British Midland Airways jet carrying 126 peoplebroke into three pieces on the edge of Britain's main north-south
Received from server -->highway, the M1, in central England on Sunday night.
Received from server -->   The twin-engine Boeing 737-400 narrowly missed the town ofKegworth and plowed into an embankment a few hundred yards short ofthe runway as the pilot struggled to make an emergency landing atEast Midland Airport, 100 miles north of London.
Received from server -->   Ham radio operator Mervyn Solloway said he heard ``not a shouted
Received from server -->message, but a bit of a frantic one to say, `We've got problems withthe other engine.' That was the last I heard from the aircraft.''
Received from server -->   British Midland Airways said sabotage was not suspected in the
Received from server -->crash, which came less than three weeks after a bomb blew apart Pan
Received from server -->Am Flight 103 over the Scottish village of Lockerbie, killing all259 people on board and 11 on the ground.   But Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who flew to the scene andvisited survivors at Derby Hospital, said: ``We rule out nothing, we
Received from server -->simply can't. There will be a lot of speculation, but until we havethe facts it is unsafe for me to speculate.''
Received from server -->   Asked about terrorism, Channon replied: ``I don't rule out
Received from server -->anything at this stage but there's certainly no evidence of it.''
Received from server -->   William Tench, retired head of Britain's Air Accident
Received from server -->Investigation Board, said the odds against both engines failing on aBoeing 737 were 10 million to one.
Received from server -->   ``I would look for some inadvertent technical mistake such as
Received from server -->something incorrect being done to the engines during turnaround,either inadvertently or deliberately,'' Tench said.   British Midland said the jet was delivered just 12 weeks ago andhad flown less than 500 hours. It grounded its other 737-400 for
Received from server -->inspection.   Pilot Kevin Hunt, a 25-year veteran, was among the badly injuredcut from the wreckage. The last survivor, a woman, was pulled from atangle of metal and crushed seats more than seven hours after the
Received from server -->crash.   The plane's two giant wings, heavily loaded with fuel, remained
Received from server -->virtually intact. The severed tail section of Flight BD92 loomedfrom woodland alongside the highway, surrounded by wreckage from the
Received from server -->severed center and nose sections.
Received from server -->   ``It makes you wonder how anybody walked from it,'' said
Received from server -->Leicestershire county Chief Fire Officer Barry Pearson.
Received from server -->   Survivor John McCrea said passengers were being served dinner
Received from server -->when the plane got into trouble soon after takeoff from London's
Received from server -->Heathrow Airport.
Received from server -->   ``The captain said `prepare for emergency landing' or something
Received from server -->to that effect, so we braced our heads and about five seconds ...afterward we were down on the ground with a crash,'' McCrea said
Received from server -->from his bed at the Derby Royal Infirmary in nearby Nottingham.
Received from server -->   Belfast lawyer Mary McHugh, 26, another survivor, said: ``Ithought we were all going to get burned alive. I just thought:`That's it, I'm dead.' I was terrified of burning to death.''   At least four British Army soldiers serving in the troubled
Received from server -->Northern Ireland province were killed. The Royal UlsterConstabulary, the Northern Ireland police force, said several of itsofficers were on board.
Received from server -->   As East Midland Airport, the airline's home base, reopened today,
Received from server -->55 relatives of the dead and injured were flown in from Belfast.   The plane took off at 7:52 p.m., and about eight minutes later
Received from server -->the captain reported ``severe vibrations in one of the engines,''said British Midland Chairman Michael Bishop.
Received from server -->   Hunt reported an engine on fire, then said he had it under
Received from server -->control and asked for clearance for an emergency landing. Witnesses
Received from server -->said the left engine was on fire as the pilot undershot the runwayby about half a mile and crashed at 8:26 p.m.</TEXT></DOC><DOC><DOCNO> AP890109-0107 </DOCNO>

Received from server -->   The tobacco industry, in newspaper ads runningaround the country Monday, touted a survey indicating three of fourAmericans don't support workplace or restaurant smoking bans.
Received from server -->   The industry's counter-initiative through its lobbyingorganization, the Tobacco Institute, comes during the week marking
Received from server -->the 25th anniversary of the first of the surgeon generals' reports
Received from server -->to declare smoking a health hazard.   A spokeswoman for the institute, Brennan Dawson, noted some
Received from server -->anti-smoking groups are pushing for a ``smoke-free'' society. ``Toachieve their purposes,'' she said, ``anti-smokers are turning to
Received from server -->censorship, harassment, punitive taxes and intrusion into personaland private decision-making.''
Received from server -->   ``The majority of Americans, according to objective polling, donot support these anti-smoking efforts,'' she said.
Received from server -->   The institute's poll was conducted by the Washington firm of
Received from server -->Hamilton, Frederick &amp; Schneiders, which said it randomly telephoned1,500 Americans over age 18 between Nov. 23 and Dec. 6, 1988. The
Received from server -->respondents included 1,099 nonsmokers and 401 smokers, the firm said.   An overwhelming number of those polled indicated they are
Received from server -->satisfied with current levels of smoking restrictions, and opposedoutright bans in the workplace or public areas. The survey has amargin of error of plus or minus three points.
Received from server -->   Among the findings:   _Eight of 10 people believe it should be left to employers andtheir employees to determine workplace smoking rules without
Received from server -->government interference.
Received from server -->   _About 74 percent believe restaurants should be allowed to offersmoking and non-smoking sections to customers.
Received from server -->   _Fifty-three percent believe excise taxes _ amounting to about athird of the price of a pack of cigarettes _ should stay the same(38 percent) or be reduced (15 percent).
Received from server -->   _Fifty-seven percent believe cigarette advertising restrictionsshould remain the same (38 percent) or be lifted entirely (23percent), as opposed to banning all advertising.
Received from server -->   The institute's newspaper ads declared ``Enough is enough!'' andsaid that meant ``enough taxation ... enough legislation ... enough
Received from server -->control ... enough censorship ... enough harassment ... enoughdiscrimination'' against smokers.

Received from server -->   Joe Weston-Webb heard the jet come lowover his home and instantly thought of Lockerbie. There was a crash,stunned silence, then screams from passengers trapped inside a webof smashed seats.
Received from server -->   ``It was horrendous,'' he said. ``It seems a miracle that any onegot out alive ... and I can't believe that it all didn't go up inflames.''
Received from server -->   The British Midland Airways Boeing 737-400 jet, with 126 peopleaboard, crashed beside the main north-south highway in centralEngland Sunday as it attempted an emergency landing at East Midlands
Received from server -->Airport. Officials said both engines apparently had failed.   The second air disaster in Britain in less than three weeks sent
Received from server -->a collective shudder through this village of 2,000 on the edge ofthe airport as residents remembered the Scottish town of Lockerbie
Received from server -->and the Dec. 21 crash of Pan Am Flight 103.   All 259 people aboard that Boeing 747 died when a bomb ripped theplane apart in the air, and 11 people in Lockerbie were killed by
Received from server -->falling wreckage.
Received from server -->   ``We have been very lucky,'' said George Mellors, 46, another
Received from server -->Kegworth resident. ``It could easily have been another Lockerbie.''
Received from server -->   David Harris ran into his garden and watched in horror as theplane flew 60 feet over his head and crashed nearby, turning the
Received from server -->night sky red.
Received from server -->   ``Thoughts of Lockerbie came into my mind,'' he said. ``The pilotdid well to avoid our built-up area in Kegworth village. It was onlyseconds away from hitting the center of the community.''   Flight 92 from London to Belfast hit an embankment on the side of
Received from server -->the M1 highway about a half-mile from the airport and broke inpieces. At least 46 people died.
Received from server -->   Rachel Meadows, 19, of Derby, said she saw the plane come downjust yards away as she was driving on the highway.
Received from server -->   ``It seemed to clip the embankment on one side of the motorway
Received from server -->and then just bounce across before it plowed into the trees. There
Received from server -->was an almighty flash but it didn't explode. A lot of cars on themotorway began to brake hard. I thought it was going to be a massive
Received from server -->pileup but luckily no cars were hit by the plane.''   Weston-Webb, 50, of nearby Sutton Bonningale, was one of the
Received from server -->first on the scene.   When he arrived, everthing was silent. ``People started screaming
Received from server -->later,'' he said.   ``The seats were all slapped on top of each other where they had
Received from server -->gone forward. And the seats had all gone forward toward the cockpitend and the people had all been shunted together. There were people
Received from server -->in a sort of concertina, you had to take the seats from the back of
Received from server -->the people in front to get them out,'' Weston-Webb said.
Received from server -->   Many seemed to have smashed ankles and legs and facial injuries,he said.
Received from server -->   Police Inspector Graham Ward said: ``It was a terrible sight.Everything was done to pull people out as quickly as possible. We
Received from server -->had to flatten trees across fields to get to the plane.''   More than seven hours after the crash, passengers were still
Received from server -->trapped in the wreckage.   The Episcopal Rev. Michael Brandon, 32, said prayers for the
Received from server -->victims.   ``I held one man's hand as he died and I whispered the Lord's

Received from server -->Brochand, the deputy permanent representative.   Brochand spoke at an emergency session convened to discuss
Received from server -->Libya's demand that the United States be condemned for shooting downthe planes Wednesday.   The United States said the planes were armed and dangerous. Libya
Received from server -->said they were unarmed and on a reconnaissance mission.   France, the first U.S. ally to speak in the debate, did not
Received from server -->support or criticize either side and is expected to abstain when theSecurity Council votes on the issue, probably Wednesday.
Received from server -->   Also speaking today were Finland, Ethiopia, Senegal, Sudan,
Received from server -->India, Morocco and Bangladesh. The session then adjourned untilTuesday, when a resolution was expected to be submitted.
Received from server -->   Except for France, major U.S. allies like Britain have not spokenand virtually all speakers have denounced or criticized the U.S.action.
Received from server -->   ``France deeply regrets the incident between Libyan and U.S. airforces,'' Brochand said. ``Our country, which borders the

Received from server -->   A court on Monday convicted a former employee of aU.S.-run Nazi document center for his role in the theft of thousands
Received from server -->of files from the facility.   The court sentenced Alfred Darko, former head of the center'sphotographic department, to two years and four months in prison.
Received from server -->Three other defendants _ all Germans _ also were convicted and givensuspended sentences.
Received from server -->   Darko, a native of the Ivory Coast, was found guilty of stealing4,000 Nazi files and selling them to dealers for up to $22,000.
Received from server -->   Chief judge Clemens Basdorf did not order Darko to prisonimmediately. Darko, who has spent nine months in investigative

Received from server -->   Basdorf said Darko was not the only employee suspected in the

Received from server -->   The Berlin Document Center contains 30 million Nazi files seizedby the Allies after World War II. Among the documents are personnel

Received from server -->   Among the documents stolen was the personnel file of formerGestapo officer Klaus Barbie, known as the Butcher of Lyon, who is
Received from server -->serving a life sentence in France for war crimes.   A marriage request by SS officer Adolf Eichmann was also among

Received from server --><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Six in 10 Americans say homelessness afflicts
Received from server -->their own communities, and a majority would pay higher federal taxesto help ease the problem, a Media General-Associated Press poll has
Received from server -->found.   The national survey found wide agreement that homelessness is a
Received from server -->serious and worsening problem and general dissatisfaction with thelevel of the federal government's response.
Received from server -->   Sixty percent of the respondents favored more federal spending
Received from server -->for the homeless, with nearly all in that group saying they wouldpay higher taxes for that purpose.
Received from server -->   Accordingly, respondents rated the problem as extraordinarilysevere. Sixty-eight percent called it ``very serious'' and 24
Received from server -->percent said ``fairly serious.''   The poll also exhibited the broad reach of homelessness:
Received from server -->Three-quarters said the problem plagues communities of all sizes,
Received from server -->not just big cities, and 59 percent said there were homeless peoplein their own communities.   The telephone survey, conducted among 1,084 randomly selected
Received from server -->adults Nov. 10-20, had a margin of error of plus or minus three
Received from server -->percentage points.
Received from server -->   The poll was completed before the holiday season and winter coldrefocused attention on the homeless. Still, 68 percent saidhomelessness was worsening, just a quarter said it was unchanged and
Received from server -->a scant 3 percent saw improvement.   A plurality said homelessness is primarily society's fault,
Received from server -->rather than the fault of the homeless themselves. Approaches such as
Received from server -->more housing for the homeless and subsidized apartments for the poorwon strong support.
Received from server -->   Views were divided on who is responsible for solutions. A 32percent plurality said the federal government was chieflyresponsible for helping homeless people; 24 percent said state
Received from server -->governments; 18 percent said local governments; and 9 percent said
Received from server -->private charities. The rest had no opinion.   Wherever prime responsibility lies, only 27 percent said the
Received from server -->federal government does enough to prevent people from becominghomeless, and 58 percent said it does not. The remaining 15 percent
Received from server -->had no answer.   Of the 60 percent who favored increasing federal spending onprograms for the homeless, 86 percent said they would be willing to
Received from server -->pay higher taxes for that purpose. Overall, 52 percent said they
Received from server -->would pay more to help the homeless.   On specific programs, 62 percent said the federal government
Received from server -->should spend more on housing for the homeless, and 65 percentfavored the preventive measure of building more federally-subsidizedhousing.
Received from server -->   Majorities of all groups favored subsidized housing, including
Received from server -->those least likely to support federal spending _ Republicans andconservatives. In virtually all measures, however, homelessness was
Received from server -->seen as a problem by greater shares of women, Democrats, liberals,
Received from server -->minorities, lower-income respondents and younger people. They alsowere more apt to blame society and to favor a broader federalresponse.
Received from server -->   For example, 78 percent of women rated the problem as ``veryserious,'' compared with 56 percent of men. Eighty-three percent of
Received from server -->Democrats said it was getting worse, compared with 54 percent of
Received from server -->Republicans. And sixty-four percent of liberals said society was atfault, compared with 37 percent of conservatives.   Of those with family incomes under $25,000 a year, 73 percent
Received from server -->favored more subsidized housing for the poor; of those earning morethan $50,000, just 54 percent agreed.
Received from server -->   Respondents were divided on whether homeless people should beallowed to live on the streets. Fifty-one percent said people shouldnot be allowed to live on the streets if they want to, but 45
Received from server -->percent said they should have that right.   On the root cause of homelessness, 45 percent said society mainly
Received from server -->is at fault and 33 percent said the homeless themselves are chieflyto blame. The rest, 22 percent, had no answer.

Received from server --><TEXT>   A trial of avowed revolutionaries thathas already cost the government millions of dollars moved toward
Received from server -->opening arguments almost a year after lawyers began selecting jurors.
Received from server -->   The three remaining defendants of eight who were captured in oneof the largest manhunts in U.S. history are accused of sedition, or
Received from server -->conspiring to topple the government by force, under a rarely invokedlaw whose meaning has been the subject of much courtroom wrangling.
Received from server -->   ``It is a serious threat to fundamental liberties,'' said PeterAvenia, one of six defense lawyers.
Received from server -->   Prosecutors contend, however, that the charge of sedition fits
Received from server -->the group they describe as a dangerous band of terrorists. A Bostoncourthouse worker lost a leg and 21 other people were wounded in one
Received from server -->of the score of bombings the group allegedly plotted from 1976 to
Received from server -->1985.   Jury selection began last March with a vast pool of jurors.Selection of the final few jurors in the U.S. District Court trialwound up this morning with the seating of 12 jurors and five
Received from server -->alternates. Opening arguments were slated to begin Tuesday.   Up to 350 witnesses could be called. A closed-circuit camera has
Received from server -->been installed with monitors in another room in case defendants areejected for unruliness. Observers must pass through two metaldetectors to reach the courtroom, which an estimated 40 marshals
Received from server -->take turns guarding.   The defendants each face up to 60 years in prison and $60,000 in
Received from server -->fines if convicted on the charges of seditious conspiracy,racketeering conspiracy and racketeering enterprise.
Received from server -->   Their attorneys argue that the trial is a waste of money becausetheir clients already have been convicted on bombing and bank
Received from server -->robbery charges and all but one are serving prison sentences. Thecost so far is estimated at well over $3 million.   The defense attorneys say the seditious conspiracy statute is so
Received from server -->broad that it could be used against protesters blocking streets.   ``If people engage in political dissent and think this can'thappen to them, they should read the statute,'' said Avenia.   The statute makes it a crime for ``two or more persons in any
Received from server -->state or territory to conspire to overthrow or put down or destroyby force the government of the United States.''
Received from server -->   The government has used the statute only a few times since it wasfirst invoked to punish Confederates during the Civil War, said
Received from server -->Arthur D. Wolf, a professor at Western New England College inSpringfield.   It was used to keep protesters from hindering the draft duringWorld War I and to prosecute Puerto Rican nationalists accused in an
Received from server -->assassination attempt against then-President Harry Truman. LastApril, nine white supremacists were acquitted of seditious

Received from server -->   _Reduce personal and business tax rates.   _Reduce the rate of growth of federal spending.
Received from server -->   _Reduce the federal regulatory burden by eliminating unnecessary

Received from server --></TEXT><TEXT>
Received from server -->   The fiscal year 1990 budget, my last, represents a continuation
Received from server -->of my efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit through restraintin domestic spending.   The budget I am submitting today complies with the deficittargets set in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings (G-R-H) Act, by proposingmeasures that meet the 1990 deficit target of $100 billion andassure a steady reduction in the deficit leading to a balancedbudget in 1993. ...
Received from server --></TEXT><TEXT>   This budget shows that a gradual elimination of the deficit ispossible without raising taxes, without cutting into essential
Received from server -->social programs, without devastating defense, and without neglectingother national priorities.
Received from server -->   It can be done in a reasonable, responsible way _ with disciplineand fairness.
Received from server -->   New taxes are not required. ...   We have an opportunity this year to put the worst of the deficit
Received from server -->problem behind us and enable the next administration to begin itsterm of office with a clean slate and with the promise of continuing
Received from server -->prosperity. ...</TEXT><TEXT>
Received from server -->   To address urgent national priorities within the deficit limitset by the G-R-H Act, my budget proposes that some programs _ such
Received from server -->as those for AIDS research and prevention, drug enforcement, andtechnology development _ receive significant funding increases,
Received from server -->while others are reduced, reformed, or, in some cases, terminated....</TEXT><TEXT>
Received from server -->   Maintaining peace and protecting our country are the foremost
Received from server -->responsibilities of the federal government.   Defense budget authority declined in real (inflation-adjusted)terms for the fourth straight year with funding of $299 billion for1989.   This trend cannot continue without severe impact on combatreadiness.   Therefore, my budget requests defense funding of $315 billion in
Received from server -->budget authority and $303 billion in outlays for 1990, and $331
Received from server -->billion in budget authority and $314 billion in outlays in 1991. ...</TEXT><TEXT>   This budget reflects my belief that addressing the problem of

Received from server -->and treatment exceeds $2.1 billion in 1989, and will approach $2.8billion in 1990. This budget asks for $1.6 billion, or 24 percentover 1989, for Public Health Service HIV funding. ...
Received from server --></TEXT><TEXT>   The program structure and incentives underlying many domestic
Received from server -->federal programs need to be altered to promote greater efficiencyand cost-effectiveness.   _Current farm price support programs are far too costly.

Received from server -->   Much of this assistance goes to farmers with high incomes _ morethan twice the U.S. family average.   I therefore propose outlay reductions for the price and income

Received from server -->through 1994. ...

Received from server -->payment system rate and reductions in hospital capital payments andspecial graduate medical education payments.
Received from server -->   Also, in an effort to restrain excessive growth in supplementary

Received from server -->   The persistence of the budget deficit is overwhelming evidencethat the federal budget process is fundamentally flawed.
Received from server -->   Past efforts at ``reform'' have been directed largely toward
Received from server -->protecting a large portion of domestic spending from real fiscaldiscipline. ...   Except for last year's on-time performance, Congress'self-imposed budget deadlines have usually been missed, and massive

Received from server -->hundreds of special interest add-ons, which line-item veto authority
Received from server -->would permit the president to challenge. ...   _I remain committed to and urge approval of a constitutional

Received from server -->   _My successors should be given the authority, subject to

Received from server -->   Deficit reduction is a key national priority, written into law bythe G-R-H Act, which, despite its defects, legislated a process to

Received from server -->   True to his word, President Reagan's final
Received from server -->budget calls for no general tax increase, although it would halt a
Received from server -->scheduled cut in aviation taxes and require all state and local
Received from server -->government workers to pay for Medicare.
Received from server -->   The budget that Reagan submitted to Congress on Monday includes a$2.1 billion tax cut for corporations and $39 million of tax relief
Received from server -->for the oil and gas industries.   Overall, revenues would drop by $1 billion, compared with currentlaw, under the budget for fiscal 1990, the 12 months that begin next
Received from server -->Oct. 1.
Received from server -->   Most of the revenue changes had been proposed a year ago; infact, the president has submitted some of them for several yearsrunning, only to have them ignored or rejected by Congress.
Received from server -->   Reagan's written message cited his final budget as evidence``that a gradual elimination of the deficit is possible withoutraising taxes....''
Received from server -->   ``Tax increases are not needed,'' the president continued. ``Taxincreases have been overwhelmingly voted down in the last three
Received from server -->presidential elections.''   However, among the hundreds of tables in the budget documents is
Received from server -->one showing that during Reagan's eight years in office, Congresspassed and he signed 13 separate tax increases that will cost
Received from server -->taxpayers $150 billion during the next budget year. Reagan-era taxreductions will save taxpayers $377 billion next year.
Received from server -->   In addition to the tax changes he proposed for 1990, Reaganrecommended $1 billion of fees on those who use selected governmentservices. The largest single provision in this package, $394
Received from server -->million, would raise the 1 percent fee for VA loan guarantees to 3.8percent and make it permanent.   Another recommendation would require middle- and upper-income
Received from server -->veterans to pay a portion of the cost of government medical care fornon-service-connected problems.
Received from server -->   Commercial and recreational boaters would have to pay a $25annual charge for using Coast Guard-patrolled waterways; entrancefees would be imposed for Corps of Engineer recreational facilities;
Received from server -->charges at Forest Service facilities would be broadened, and the feeon Commodity Credit Corp. loan guarantees would double, to 1.2
Received from server -->percent.   Among the tax proposals:
Received from server -->   _Repeal a law requiring that taxes on airplane tickets (8percent), air shippers (5 percent) and plane fuel be cut in half
Received from server -->next Jan. 1 unless federal spending for airports and airways reachesa certain level. That level is not expected to be reached, butReagan called for keeping those taxes at current rates, which would
Received from server -->cost shippers and travelers $1.2 billion.
Received from server -->   _Require all state and local government workers to pay the taxthat funds Medicare; those hired before April 1, 1986, are notpaying, even though most are eligible for Medicare because of
Received from server -->earlier, non-government employment or through their spouses. Thiswould raise $2 billion.
Received from server -->   _Permit corporations that operate abroad to allocate at leasttwo-thirds of their total research costs to domestic income, savingthem $1.7 billion.
Received from server -->   _Make permanent a 20 percent tax credit for increased spendingfor research, saving those businesses $400 milllion.
Received from server -->   _Liberalize deductions permitted oil and gas producers for

Received from server --><DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   China's most prominent dissident on Monday calledfor the release of the nation's most famous political prisoner. In
Received from server -->Shanghai, meanwhile, a pro-democracy activist was let out of jail.
Received from server -->   Fang Lizhi, an internationally respected astrophysicist, saidfreeing all political prisoners, especially Wei Jingsheng, ``would
Received from server -->be a humanitarian gesture and would have a beneficial effect on oursocial morale.''
Received from server -->   Fang made his call in a letter to Chinese leader Deng Xiaopingthat was obtained Monday.   Wei, an electrician by profession, wrote a series of articles on
Received from server -->the need for democracy in 1978 during the ``Beijing Spring,'' aperiod of relative political liberalization shortly after the end of
Received from server -->the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution. He was arrested on March 29,1979, and sentenced to 15 years in prison for``counterrevolutionary'' crimes.
Received from server -->   Amnesty Internatiomal, a London-based human rights group, hasadopted Wei as a prisoner of conscience. Human rights groups have
Received from server -->variously reported that Wei has died or is suffering from severe
Received from server -->schizophrenia in custody.   Amnesty International estimates thousands of Chinese are inprison for crimes of conscience.   Fang was expelled from the Communist Party and fired from hispost as vice chairman of the Chinese Science and TechnologyUniversity in Hefei in 1987 for allegedly fomenting pro-democracy
Received from server -->unrest among the nation's students.   He later was given a position as a high-level researcher at theChinese Academy of Sciences and allowed to travel abroad. China has
Received from server -->denied Fang's most recent request to go to the United States.
Received from server -->   In winter 1986-87, hundreds of thousands of students marched incities and called for democracy in China.
Received from server -->   Yang Wei, a former student at the University of Arizona, was one
Received from server -->of the demonstrators.
Received from server -->   On Monday, Yang was released from the Ti Lan Qiao Prison inShanghai after serving one year of a two-year sentence for``counterrevolutionary'' activities.   The Shanghai Foreign Affairs office said Yang was released Monday
Received from server -->because he had already spent about a year in custody before beingsentenced.   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Yang said his
Received from server -->first concern was the health of his father, who has cancer.
Received from server -->   ``I'm going to see him today,'' said Yang. ``He is in thehospital and he is in serious condition.''   Yang said he did not regret marching for democracy and writing
Received from server -->for ``China Spring,'' the banned periodical of the Chinese Alliancefor Democracy, a U.S.-based dissident group. But he said he was
Received from server -->unclear whether he would continue working for political change inChina.
Received from server -->   Yang described his treatment in prison as ``pretty good.''   ``It seemed that I was given special treatment,'' he said.
Received from server -->   Yang, 33, who received a masters degree in molecular biology fromArizona, said he would like to return to the United States to
Received from server -->continue his studies.   Sources close to the family said Yang's release was delayed by
Received from server -->several hours because three members of the Chinese Alliance for
Received from server -->Democracy were apprehended in Shanghai over the weekend with copiesof ``China Spring'' and a letter for Ywng.
Received from server -->   The alliance was set up in 1983 by a former Chinese citizen inorder to promote democracy in China. Chinese officials have declared
Received from server -->it an illegal organization.   The men _ a Chinese-American, a Chinese-Canadian and a Chinese
Received from server -->citizen _ were put on flights out of China after they admittedbreaking the law, official reports said.
Received from server -->   It was not clear why the Chinese citizen, who is a student atUtah State University, was allowed to leave.
Received from server -->   Yang was sentenced in December 1987. He had been held without
Received from server -->charges since January 1987 in the student protests.   Prosecutors accused Yang of stirring up anti-government protests
Received from server -->in Shanghai. The court said he put up ``reactionary slogans'' atShanghai's Fudan University on Dec. 22, 1986, during student
Received from server -->demonstrations.   On Dec. 3, 1987, the U.S. Congress called for Yang's release,
Received from server -->saying he had broken no Chinese or U.S. laws.
Received from server -->   China labeled the move ``an undisguised interference in China's
Received from server -->internal affairs.''   Yang's wife, Che Shaoli, a medical student in the United States,
Received from server -->said she was thrilled at his release. ``But I am sad, too,'' shesaid in a telephone interview from New York. ``I don't know when I
Received from server -->will see him.''</TEXT></DOC>

Received from server --><TEXT>   The Soviet Union is trying to foster atechnological spurt with a proposal to offer tax breaks forstate-run enterprises that put new inventions to use, an officialsaid Monday.
Received from server -->   I.S. Nayashkov, chairman of the State Committee on Inventions andDiscoveries, told a news conference that a draft law on inventionsproposes giving a three-year income tax exemption to state-run
Received from server -->businesses that put inovations to use.   Officials hope such a move will ``increase the interest of
Received from server -->enterprises in inventive work or in research and development,'' he
Received from server -->said. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev says more modern technology is
Received from server -->a key to modernizing Soviet industry and providing a higher standardof living.
Received from server -->   The draft law was published in the official press Dec. 27, andmust be approved by the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, at one of its
Received from server -->sessions in 1989. It is unclear yet when it will go into effect.
Received from server -->   The law also would allow the establishment of venture banks toencourage investors and set aside ``patent funds'' to help inventors
Received from server -->without the means to support their work, Nayashkov said.
Received from server -->   He said there has been ``little movement and weak dynamics'' in
Received from server -->recent years, with the number of applications for patents and the
Received from server -->number actually registered remaining virtually without change.   Since 1983-84, Soviets have applied for between 170,000 and
Received from server -->190,000 patents annually and 70,000-80,000 have been granted, he
Received from server -->said. The remainder were judged not to offer anything substantiallynew or valuable.
Received from server -->   Nayashkov said the law also seeks to better protect foreigners by
Received from server -->bringing Soviet patent law closer to a convention signed inWashington in 1970, and gives Soviets the right to register their
Received from server -->inventions in foreign countries instead of the Soviet Union as longas their inventions don't concern defense matters or state secrets.

Received from server --><TEXT>
Received from server -->   Soviet officials will conduct a census beginningThursday that they say will give them a much broader understanding
Received from server -->of the population and citizens' living conditions.
Received from server -->   More than a million students, teachers and white-collar workerswill fan out across the vast country from Jan. 12-19 with a
Received from server -->questionnaire that for the first time will ask a series of questionsabout housing conditions.
Received from server -->   But Mikhail S. Korolev, chairman of the State StatisticsCommittee, said no questions will be asked about religion, or about
Received from server -->salaries.   Previous surveys have determined that the population does not
Received from server -->give reliable answers about their income, he said. ``Some people
Received from server -->hide their income. Some people increase it before other members ofthe family. Some people fantasize,'' he said.
Received from server -->   Korolev pledged that all responses will be confidential, sealed
Received from server -->by census workers after the information is fed into computer. Hesaid the results will be made public, but not as early as officials
Received from server -->originally thought.
Received from server -->   ``There will be no disclosure of personal data to anyone,''
Received from server -->Korolev told a news conference.
Received from server -->   The census has been extended until Feb. 11 in Armenia because ofthe Dec. 7 earthquake, and that means initial figures won't be
Received from server -->available in April as scientists originally thought, Korolev said.   Some Soviet publications contend that dictator Josef Stalin
Received from server -->falsified census data in the 1930s and destroyed a 1937 census tohide massive deaths caused by his collectivization of agriculture
Received from server -->and purges.   Korolev said he knew of no cases of falsifying census data, but
Received from server -->that the results from the 1937 census were missing.   In 1934, Stalin announced a population figure of 168 million,
Received from server -->even though the official figure was 165.7 million and one scientistput the actual figure as low as 158 million.
Received from server -->   Soviet reference books put the population at the time of the 1917Bolshevik Revolution at 163 million, and Korolev said experts
Received from server -->estimate the population now is about 287 million.
Received from server -->   The head of the statistics committee said questions about housingthat will appear for the first time include the age of housing in
Received from server -->which respondents live, what the buildings are made of, whether the
Received from server -->housing is state-owned or cooperative, the number of rooms and thefloor area.
Received from server -->   That list of questions, developed along United Nationsguidelines, will give officials an idea of what kinds of housing are
Received from server -->most durable as well as firm data about what kinds of housingSoviets are living in, he said.
Received from server -->   Housing is one of the sore spots in efforts to improve livingconditions, and about one in five still lives in communal housing.
Received from server -->Much of the housing, such as that which collapsed in the Armenianearthquake, is of poor construction.
Received from server -->   The last full census 10 years ago showed a population of 262
Received from server -->million. A pilot census was taken five years ago.</TEXT>

Received from server --><TEXT>   Libya's official news agency on Mondaycriticized foreign journalists who reported there were weapons
Received from server -->around the desert factory the United States alleges is a chemical
Received from server -->weapons plant.
Received from server -->   About 100 journalists were expelled from Libya on Sunday, andabout 30 others were told late Sunday that they had to depart Monday.
Received from server -->   They arrived last week after U.S. fighter jets shot down twoLibyan warplanes over the Mediterranean.
Received from server -->   The expulsion orders came a few hours after the journalists were
Received from server -->taken Saturday evening to the plant at Rabta, 60 miles southwest ofTripoli.   Libya insists the plant is designed for producing medicine.
Received from server -->   Journalists were not allowed inside the plant, and because it wasnightfall when they arrived by bus, they could see very little from
Received from server -->the outside.   Clearly visible, however, was a ring of surface-to-air missiles
Received from server -->around the plant, as well as a concrete-based radar station a fewmiles away. Libyan officials said the defenses were put into place
Received from server -->after President Reagan last month said he could not rule out amilitary strike against the plant.
Received from server -->   Libya's official news agency, JANA, on Monday said thejournalists were invited to see the plant ``as an expression of good
Received from server -->will and out of its concern to enable them to acquaint themselveswith the reality of a small country upon which aggression and
Received from server -->confrontation are imosed by a superpower, namely America.   ``Statements in some news reports that the mere fact of the
Received from server -->journalists seeing the buildings did not help determine the natureof these buildings and that there are weapons, guns and buildings
Received from server -->are inaccurate and lack objectivity,'' JANA said. ``The journalists,unless they are are specially qualified, are not experts in
Received from server -->determining the nature of the factory and its installations.   ``Adopting the argument of the existence of guns and weapons in
Received from server -->the area surrounding the factory to give it another character fallsin line with the desires of some and the reply to it is: in the face
Received from server -->of the threats of America to deal a blow to the area, are the masseswho are staging a sit-in there not entitled to make available themeans to defend the area and to protect themselves?'' the dispatch
Received from server -->said.   Libya, it said, ``in so far as it is concerned with enablingjournalists to carry out their professional duties, requires the
Received from server -->necessary commitment to the rules of neutrality, objectivity and
Received from server -->impartiality'' from journalists.
Received from server -->   Libya's foreign minister, in Paris for a conference on chemicalweapons, said Sunday his country had no plans to manufacture
Received from server -->chemical weapons. When asked if Libya planned to make such arms, hereplied: ``You will never know.''

Received from server --><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan on Monday asked Congress for a
Received from server -->small increase in funding for veterans' medical care and pensions as
Received from server -->he proposed outlays of $29.9 billion for the new Department ofVeterans Affairs.   Outlays for the Veterans Administration, which provided benefits
Received from server -->and services to veterans for 58 years, are estimated to be $29.2billion in fiscal 1989. The budget for the new department, which
Received from server -->assumes Cabinet status in March, calls for a $700 million increase.   Among the budget proposals are a slight increase in outlays formedical care, including the treatment provided to veterans at
Received from server -->hospitals, nursing homes and on an outpatient basis. In fiscal 1989,
Received from server -->outlays totaled $11.4 billion. The 1990 budget calls for $11.5billion.
Received from server -->   Outlays for construction of state extended care facilitiesincreased from $37 million in 1989 to $44 million in 1990 whileoutlays for major project construction was cut from $527 million to
Received from server -->$514 million.   The budget proposes using construction funds for two largehospital projects in Palm Beach, Fla., and Newington, Conn.
Received from server -->   Proposed outlays for total pensions are $4 billion, a $94 million
Received from server -->increase over the estimated total for fiscal 1989. Veterans age 65or older with low incomes and wartime-service are entitled to the
Received from server -->pensions. The wartime-service does not differentiate between combator non-combat duty.   The pension payments also included a 4 percent cost-of-living
Received from server -->increase effective this month.
Received from server -->   Total outlays for income security for disabled, aged or deceasedveterans in the 1990 budget are $16.4 billion, up from $15.6 billinin 1989.   The Reagan administration, in the budget, also recommends linking
Received from server -->future veterans compensation cost-of-living adjustments to annualchanges in the Consumer Price Index.
Received from server -->   The administration also proposes changes in the veterans housing
Received from server -->program, including orgination fees for participating in federalcredit programs. The budget plan did not specify the cost of thefees.
Received from server -->   Two other recommendations affecting housing for veterans proposelegislation to increase the expiring fee charged on guaranteedhousing loans and vendee loans and to allow negotiated interestrates on guaranteed mortgages.
Received from server -->   The expiring fee charge would increase from 1 percent to 3.8percent of the mortgage amount and the borrower could add the fee to
Received from server -->the mortgage. A vendee loan is a direct loan made to veterans and
Received from server -->non-veterans who purchase property that the Veterans Administrationacquired through defaults.
Received from server -->   The administration also is seeking budget authority of $1.5million for the court of Veterans Appeals, which would allow
Received from server -->veterans to appeal some benefit decisions of the department's Boardof Veterans' Appeals.
Received from server -->   Facing a major cut are grants for the construction of stateveterans cemeteries, which would be reduced from $5 million in 1989
Received from server -->to $1.9 million in 1990.   The funding would be used to expand national cemeteries at FortSnelling, Minn., and Jefferson Barracks, Mo.

Received from server -->for construction of a soccer stadium in Jerusalem, a move opposed by
Received from server -->ultra-Orthodox Jews who fear weekend games will desecrate theSabbath.
Received from server -->   The ruling, which orders the Interior Ministry to sign the
Received from server -->building permit, ended a 15-year battle to get the athletic fieldbuilt, according to the office of Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek.   Kollek hailed the decision as a victory for Jerusalem's youth,
Received from server -->who must travel to the coastal city of Jaffa to see Betar Jerusalem,the team with the largest following.
Received from server -->   Kollek, along with liberal parliament member Dedi Zucker and a
Received from server -->group of sports fans, filed the petition to the high court a yearand a half ago.   ``I share the happiness of the residents and sports fans of thecapital,'' Kollek said in a statement.
Received from server -->   He said the stadium would be built ``as soon as possible,''
Received from server -->adding: ``September's soccer season will open in a new stadium.''
Received from server -->   Construction has been blocked by the Interior Ministry, whichrefused to sign the building permit despite approval for the arenafrom all necessary local government and planning authorities.   The ministry, which traditionally is headed by an Orthodoxminister, argued that noise from the stadium and its parking lotcould disrupt religious Jews on the Sabbath, which begins at sundown
Received from server -->Friday and continues until sundown Saturday.
Received from server -->   The religious also argued that building the stadium wouldencourage Jews to break the Sabbath by driving to see games.   Most soccer games in Israel are played on Saturday.
Received from server -->   Interior Ministry Spokeswoman Tova Elinson said there would be nocomment on the ruling until the minister, Arye Deri, returned fromthe United States on Tuesday.   The 12,000-seat stadium is to be built in the Malha neighborhoodin southwestern Jerusalem. Many residents of the Bayit Vagan
Received from server -->neighborhood to the north are Orthodox Jews.
Received from server -->   The site has a grass playing field but no seating and no parkingfacilities. Construction is expected to cost about $24 million.
Received from server -->   Zucker, a member of the left-leaning Citizens Rights Party,
Received from server -->described the ruling as a victory for secular Jews. He noted 18months ago ``we opened the town for theaters and movies on Fridays,and now we have given the town what it is entitled to have, like any

Received from server --><TEXT>   The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to study thepower of judges to impose harsher sentences on defendants who back
Received from server -->out of plea-bargain agreements.   The justices said they will consider reinstating the life
Received from server -->sentence of an Alabama man convicted of burglary. Before standing
Received from server -->trial in 1986, James Lewis Smith had pleaded guilty to the burglary
Received from server -->charge and had been sentenced to 30 years in prison for it.
Received from server -->   Smith had been indicted in Montgomery on charges of rape,burglary and sodomy _ all arising from the same incident. In a
Received from server -->plea-bargain agreement, he pleaded guilty to rape and burglary, and
Received from server -->the sodomy charge was dropped.   Smith was sentenced to 30 years on each of the two counts, with
Received from server -->the sentences to run concurrently.   He then sought to withdraw his guilty plea, and a state appeals
Received from server -->court allowed him to do so. It ruled that Smith had not beeninformed that he would be sentenced as a repeat offender, and would
Received from server -->be subject to stiffer penalties than he expected.   Smith stood trial, was convicted and then was sentenced by thesame state judge who had earlier accepted his plea bargain.
Received from server -->   The judge sentenced Smith to separate life terms for the sodomy
Received from server -->and burglary convictions, and to 150 years for the rape conviction.
Received from server -->   A state appeals court upheld the life terms for sodomy andburglary, but set aside the sentence for Smith's rape conviction.   The Alabama Supreme Court last June 24 threw out Smith's life
Received from server -->sentence on the burglary conviction, ruling that it representedjudicial vindictiveness.
Received from server -->   ``It is clear that the trial judge increased (Smith's) sentence
Received from server -->because of his subjective observations and not because of anyobjective evidence of events subsequent to (Smith's) first
Received from server -->conviction,'' the state said.   The June ruling did not affect Smith's life sentence for thesodomy conviction.   State Attorney General Don Siegelman appealed the Alabama Supreme
Received from server -->Court ruling, asking the nation's highest court to draw adistinction between cases in which defendants withdraw guilty pleas
Received from server -->and those in which they are resentenced after successful appeals.
Received from server -->   The Supreme Court in 1969 limited judges' power to impose more
Received from server -->stringent sentences after defendants successfully appealed their
Received from server -->original prison terms.   The current case is Alabama vs. Smith, 88-333.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>

Received from server -->   Americans must look to the government _ not theprivate sector _ to meet their long-term health care needs through acomprehensive program financed with increased taxes, a nationalconsumer group said Monday.   In an analysis of the growing long-term care problem facing the
Received from server -->nation and the major proposals in Congress to address it, Consumers
Received from server -->Union recommends creation of a universal insurance program fundedwith taxes and premiums.   Consumers Union's criticism of private long-term health care
Received from server -->insurance is based on a survey last May by Consumer Reports, the
Received from server -->group's product-testing publication. But the Health InsuranceAssociation of America said the policies that were rated by the
Received from server -->publication were old and are not representative of those beingoffered today.
Received from server -->   Consumers Union outlined proposals for a basic program at fourfederal spending levels, ranging up to $50 billion _ far more than
Received from server -->the state and federal governments now spend on long-term care _ andsaid that even the more expensive proposals don't have to worsen the
Received from server -->federal deficit.   Revenue options include increasing the Social Security payrolltax, establishing a broad-based payroll tax for long-term care,
Received from server -->imposing an income tax surcharge, increasing gift and estate taxes,raising alcohol or gasoline excise taxes and requiring payment of
Received from server -->premiums.   ``We should not let the budget deficit be used as an excuse for
Received from server -->no action or inappropriate action,'' said Gail Shearer, author ofthe report.
Received from server -->   Part of the problem, the report says, is the growing cost of
Received from server -->long-term care financed through Medicaid, which diverts funds neededto provide acute health care to the poor.
Received from server -->   Also, current policies force people to ``spend down'' theirassets and income to qualify for Medicaid benefits. With annual
Received from server -->nursing home charges averaging about $26,000 per resident, a
Received from server -->condition Consumers Union calls ``long-term care-induced poverty''
Received from server -->comes quickly for many.
Received from server -->   Also, people who care for family members at home often can get
Received from server -->little or no paid assistance, resulting in financial, physical andemotional strain on the caregiver, the report said.   The private insurance industry is ``incapable'' of solving the
Received from server -->problem, the report said. Too often companies reject applicants withhigher than average health risks, and policies are expensive,
Received from server -->costing up to $100 per month for a 65-year-old and more for older
Received from server -->applicants, the report said.   Many policies restrict benefits for more expensive custodial care
Received from server -->and require prior hospitalization before paying benefits while few
Received from server -->policies protect against inflation, Consumers Union said.   ``Private insurance is unlikely to be available to people at highrisk and will remain unaffordable by most people,'' the report said.
Received from server -->   But Susan Van Gelder, associate director of policy developmentand research at the insurance association, said most policies issuedin the last six months have eliminated many of the restrictions in
Received from server -->the old policies and most now recognize inflation.   Long-term care, according to the definition used in the Consumers
Received from server -->Union report, is the help ``needed to cope, and sometimes survive,when physical or mental disabilities impair the capacity to perform
Received from server -->the basic activities of everyday life, such as eating, toileting,bathing, dressing and moving about.''   The federal government in 1987 spent about $11.1 billion on care
Received from server -->in skilled nursing facilities and intermediate-care facilities, and
Received from server -->states added $8.9 billion for these services, according to HHS.Figures for 1988 were not available, the department said.
Received from server -->   Consumers Union said its ``low option'' would cost an additional$10 billion in federal money, which would be spent primarily tofinance a comprehensive home health care program for people of all
Received from server -->ages. It also would include a voluntary long-term care policy fornursing home coverage.
Received from server -->   A $20 billion program could include comprehensive home health
Received from server -->care benefits as well as nursing home coverage for the first sixmonths of care and a voluntary insurance program for long-term
Received from server -->nursing home stays _ a benefits package similar to that proposed bySen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.   The group's $50 billion plan would include the elements of the
Received from server -->previous option with expanded nursing home care benefits.</TEXT></DOC>

Received from server -->   Libya's foreign minister said today the UnitedStates has launched ``vile campaigns'' against Libya while helping
Received from server -->Israel build a stockpile of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.   Foreign Minister Jadallah Azouz Ettalhi also said U.S.
Received from server -->allegations Libya has a plant intended to build chemical weapons are``clearly false.''
Received from server -->   Earlier, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze saidevidence shown him by Secretary of State George Shultz did not provethe U.S. allegations.
Received from server -->   Addressing an international conference on chemical weapons,Ettalhi said the U.S. position on chemical weapons is discriminatory.   ``How can any member of the international community proclaim aright it denies others, and how can it stand in the way of
Received from server -->international efforts at eradicating these weapons while, at the
Received from server -->same time, launching vile campaigns of calumny on the basis of adiscriminatory, racist position, basing itself on accusations whichare clearly false,'' he said.
Received from server -->   The Libyan minister claimed Israel has nuclear, chemical and
Received from server -->biological weapons stockpiles and that the United States providesfinancing and technical assistance.
Received from server -->   ``This power (the United States) doesn't hesitate to aggress thevictim. This situation is dangerous,'' Ettalhi said. ``Agreed
Received from server -->international rules must be applied to all parties withoutdiscrimination.''   The five-day conference, which began Saturday, was called tobolster flagging talks on a chemical weapons ban.
Received from server -->   The United States and the Soviet Union are the only two countriesto admit possessing chemical weapons. According to U.S. estimates,about 20 countries possess or have the ability to manufacturechemical weapons.   The only existing document on chemical weapons, the 1925 Geneva
Received from server -->Protocol, bans only their use, and without enforcement power, isregarded as inadequate by many nations.   Vice Premier Tariq Aziz of Iraq led a move Sunday against a banon chemical arms unless nuclear weapons are also banned. He saidIsrael has ``nuclear weapons as well as chemical weapons andmissiles that can reach many Arab cities.''
Received from server -->   Israel called the Iraqi statement ``blatant hypocrisy.'' Iraq isknown to have used chemical weapons in its 8-year war with Iran.   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Israel today accused Iraq, Libyaand Syria of having chemical arms, telling conference delegates thatthese weapons have been used ``by countries that made no attempt to
Received from server -->hide or disguise their hostility to Israel.''   Shultz met Shevardnadze on Sunday and said he had won a promisefrom the Soviets to conduct their own inquiry into the plant atRabta, south of Tripoli. He said at the time he believed the Sovietsultimately would back the U.S.   Libya has denied its plant can make chemical weapons, claiming it
Received from server -->is intended to produce pharmaceuticals.   ``The American secretary of state showed me the building plan,but that proves nothing,'' Shevardnadze told reporters today justbefore leaving Paris for Moscow.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman saidShultz had given Shevardnadze limited information only to show the
Received from server -->information was ``detailed and serious.''   ``In response, the foreign minister indicated the Soviets tookthese issues seriously and would be looking into it and askingquestions,'' Redman said. ``That's what's important.''   Shevardnadze told reporters he had told Shultz that ``the most
Received from server -->important thing is to stabilize the situation after the airincident'' during which American fighters shot down two Libyanwarlanes over the Mediterranean last week.   On Sunday, the Soviet Union announced it would start destroyingchemical arms stockpiles. U.S. officials said the Soviets weremerely playing ``catch-up'' because the United States has been
Received from server -->routinely destroying stockpiles of aging chemical arms since theearly 1980s.   Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union will not wait for disarmament
Received from server -->negotiators in Geneva to reach an accord banning use, production andstockpiling of chemical arms. He said a new Soviet facility todestroy chemical weapons will go into operation this year.
Received from server -->   The envoy said his country has stopped production of chemicalweapons, an announcement first made in April 1987.
Received from server -->   Lynn Hansen, director ofthe bureau of multilateral affairs at the
Received from server -->U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said the Soviet position``now corresponds to our own position. ... We simply don't get the
Received from server -->press, because for us it's more routine.   ``When they do it, all of a sudden it's news,'' Hansen toldreporters.
Received from server -->   The United States halted production of chemical weapons in 1969but resumed 18 years later to counter the Soviet build-up. TheSoviet Union says it has 50,000 tons of chemical arms stockpiled,while the United States has about 30,000 tons. Both figures are
Received from server -->thought to be largely underestimated.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>

Received from server -->   When Eddie McClary was found dead in twofeet of fermenting mash at a gasohol plant nearly nine years ago,
Received from server -->the case was ruled an accidental drowning and his boss collected
Received from server -->$50,000 in life insurance.
Received from server -->   Now an investigation by the The State newspaper of Columbia has
Received from server -->turned up suggestions that McClary may have been murdered. Among
Received from server -->other things, the newspaper reported a statement by Williamsburg
Received from server -->County Sheriff's Deputy Daniel N. Blunt Sr. _ which he has sincedisavowed _ that he had a suspect in the case.   McClary, 23, was found dead March 3, 1980, in a tank at the
Received from server -->Carolina Alcohol Co. plant in Kingstree, where he was head chemist.The plant, designed to produce ethanol for an alternative togasoline known as gasohol, was owned by state Rep. B.J. Gordon, a
Received from server -->longtime political power in the area.   Although relatives and rescue workers were suspicious, a
Received from server -->coroner's inquest ruled the case an accident, and Gordon collected$50,000 from a policy protecting the company against the death of akey employee. The plant later folded and the Farmers Home
Received from server -->Administration, which backed $420,000 in loans for the project,footed the bill, The State reported in its stories on the casepublished Jan. 1.
Received from server -->   Blunt concluded at the time that McClary's death was an accident,as did state and federal authorities. The latter two said the scope
Received from server -->of their investigations was limited by the rulings from localauthorities, The State reported. Blunt told the newspaper his owninvestigation was curtailed because he resigned his deputy's post torun for sheriff, an election he lost.
Received from server -->   The newspaper said Gordon testified the next year as a characterwitness for Blunt while the officer was on trial on charges of
Received from server -->official corruption, including taking bribes. Blunt was convictedbut pardoned by the state parole board in 1983 and rehired bySheriff Theodore McFarlin, who said he was his best investigator.
Received from server -->   According to The State, Blunt told reporters he had always beensuspicious about McClary's death and still had a suspect, althoughhe refused to identify him. ``A lot of things about this case bother
Received from server -->me,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.   Specifically, the newspaper said Blunt acknowledged that during
Received from server -->his investigation he didn't ask how McClary had scaled the10-foot-tall fermentation tank without a ladder, didn't question
Received from server -->cuts and bruises on the body, and didn't try to find out how a grownman could have fallen through a small hatch atop the tank and
Received from server -->drowned in 24 inches of mash.   After the stories appeared in The State, Blunt told The News andCourier of Charleston that he had been misquoted.   ``Ain't nobody murdered that boy. The State reporters asked me if
Received from server -->there was anything suspicious. I said a lawman's always suspicious.That doesn't mean I suspect murder in this case,'' Blunt told theCharleston paper.
Received from server -->   The State's managing editor, Robert Hitt, said the newspaperstood by its story. He said that although the interview with Bluntwas not taped, the two reporters present took extensive notes.
Received from server -->   The State said its stories were based on a seven-monthexamination of more than 3,000 pages of state and federal records,some obtained through use of the Freedom of Information Act.
Received from server -->   Hugh Munn, a spokesman for the State Law Enforcement Division,said Blunt denied having a suspect when he spoke to agents from his
Received from server -->department last week.   Munn said his agency also questioned several other people ``butthere was no new evidence, so there's nothing more we can do.''
Received from server -->   McFarlin, the Williamsburg sheriff, said last week he did notplan to reopen the case. Mark Dillard, a spokesman for state
Received from server -->Attorney General Travis Medlock, said his office had examined the
Received from server -->newspaper's report but found nothing to warrant further action.   Gov. Carroll Campbell said he supported the decision not toofficially reopen the case. ``I have to trust the law enforcementofficials,'' Campbell said.
Received from server -->   Tommy Gamble, one of the rescue workers who pulled McClary's bodyfrom the vat, said he was interviewed Tuesday by three law
Received from server -->enforcement division agents. Gamble said he told the agents that hewould ``die and go to hell 40 times before they'd make me believe he
Received from server -->died in an accident.''
Received from server -->   Lichi Boggs, McClary's mother, said she remains convinced her sonwas murdered. ``If I had millions of dollars to prove it, I would
Received from server -->fight it to the end,'' she said.   Gordon, after repeatedly refusing calls and visits by State
Received from server -->reporters, told The Associated Press he has suffered greatly fromMcClary's death.
Received from server -->   ``I suffered a lot of pain from that business venture. I suffered
Received from server -->pain from the loss of a friend. ... I feel sorry for people whoforever try to open wounds and bring about pain.''
Received from server -->   Gordon gained national attention last year when he and state Sen.Frank McGill filed charges of criminal libel against newspaper
Received from server -->editor Jim Fitts. Fitts was arrested and spent a weekend in jailafter he wrote a column critical of the two men. Gordon and McGill,

Received from server -->next year, down from $11 billion this year.   As of Dec. 22, the bank had guaranteed $239 million worth of

Received from server --><TEXT>   A nurse's colleagues jokingly calledher ``Angel of Death'' because elderly patients kept dying during
Received from server -->her shift. Now, she is going on trial, charged with killing 17patients in a two-year period.
Received from server -->   Michaela Roeder admits giving the fatal doses to six of thepatients, and says she did it to spare them pain. But prosecutor
Received from server -->Karl Hermann Majorowsky alleges she did it just as a ``demonstrationof her power.''
Received from server -->   ``The accused posed as a mistress over life and death. We aredealing here with cold-blooded murder out of base motives,'' a Jan.9 issue of Der Spiegel magazine quoted Majorowsky as saying.
Received from server -->   Ms. Roeder's murder trial begins Tuesday in district court inWuppertal, about 37 miles north of Bonn. She faces a possible
Received from server -->sentence of life in prison if convicted.   The accusations against Ms. Roeder, 30, have absorbed the West
Received from server -->German press, who have called the alleged killings ``nearly theperfect murder'' because they went almost unnoticed by police.
Received from server -->   On a tip from a hospital employee, authorities had the bodies of28 deceased former patients of the intensive care unit at St. Petrus
Received from server -->Hospital in Wuppertal exhumed.   According to court records, the examinations showed that 17 of
Received from server -->the patients had received a ``fatal dose'' of drugs that canseverely affect blood pressure or the heart.   Ms. Roeder is accused of issuing the fatal injections between
Received from server -->February 1984 and February 1986 while working in the St. Petrusintensive care section.
Received from server -->   After Ms. Roeder's arrest in March 1986, she admitted to lawofficials that she gave fatal injections to six patients because she
Received from server -->wanted to spare them suffering from their ailments. Majorowsky saysin court papers there are ``no clues that these patients would have
Received from server -->died.''   Most of the 17 patients were elderly and had been brought to the
Received from server -->intensive care section after operations for ailments ranging fromappendicitis to cancer, according to news reports. The oldest victim
Received from server -->was 94, according to the reports.   The official cause of death for the 17 patients was heart or
Received from server -->circulatory failure, the reports said.
Received from server -->   Ms. Roeder began working at the hospital in 1978 and was jokinglydubbed the ``Angel of Death'' by her colleagues when elderly
Received from server -->patients under her care started dying, according to Der Spiegel.   ``They didn't call Michaela Roeder the `Angel of Death' because
Received from server -->they suspected foul play,'' the magazine wrote. ``The little joke in
Received from server -->this name was meant to help console her over her bad luck and theseunfortunate coincidences.''
Received from server -->   The magazine said Majorowsky is expected to have difficultyproving murder against Ms. Roeder.   ``The weak point of the charge is the motive brought against thedefendant. Killing in order to demonstrate power, to feel that she
Received from server -->was a mistress over life or death?,'' the magazine askedrhetorically.   Der Spiegel said the trial will likely investigate whether Ms.
Received from server -->Roeder may have been unable to withstand the stress and demands ofworking in an intensive care unit. More than 40 witnesses and
Received from server -->medical experts are expected to testify.
Received from server -->   If there is insufficient evidence for premeditated murder, Ms.
Received from server -->Roeder could be found guilty of manslaughter, which carries a
Received from server -->minimum sentence of five years in prison.</TEXT>

Received from server -->The earthquake killed 24,888 people and left 500,000 homeless.   But the Armenian ministry of light industry was censured because
Received from server -->it did not produce ``specific proposals for the employment of 40,000people and for improvement in their living conditions,'' the
Received from server -->official news agency said.   About 80,000 children remain in the disaster area, but theArmenian ministry of public education ``has taken practically no
Received from server -->serious steps to organize their upbringing and instruction,'' Tasssaid.   The Soviet ministry of railways, however, was praised for
Received from server -->developing plans to double the freight hauled on Armenia's two mainlines to 40 million tons a year, the report said. Transport
Received from server -->officials earlier came under strong criticism as thousands ofrailcars packed with relief supplies piled up at stations and onside tracks for lack of sufficient labor to unload them.

Received from server -->   Palm Beach County dumped a milliongallons of chlorinated raw sewage from an affluent suburb into theAtlantic Ocean rather than let it spill onto property and into
Received from server -->canals.   ``The two alternatives were not very attractive,'' said HealthDepartment engineering director Frank Gargiulo. ``One was
Received from server -->discharging sewage on the ground. The other was discharging it intothe ocean.''   Health department officials banned swimming, surfing and wading
Received from server -->on 13 miles of beach from Singer Island to Lantana for about 24hours.   The problem started with the shutdown of a regional treatment
Received from server -->plant early Sunday to bring a new section on line.   ``This was a planned event,'' Gargiulo said. ``At night, theydon't generate as much sewage.''
Received from server -->   But Lake Worth produced more waste than expected. By 2 a.m.,officials were worried about it spilling and seeping onto the ground.
Received from server -->   For about three hours, waste flowed from a pumping stationthrough a pipe that extends about a mile into the Atlantic Ocean,officials said.
Received from server -->   Dumping raw waste there is illegal, but Gargiulo described thestep as ``the lesser of two evils.''   Don White, a state Department of Environmental Regulation
Received from server -->official, was present when the waste was discharged. ``They hademergency approval from us,'' he said Monday.
Received from server -->   ``Up until 25 to 30 years ago, all of the domestic waste from the
Received from server -->Lake Worth area was discharged through that outflow,'' he said,
Received from server -->``but it has not been used for 25 years routinely.''   White said he didn't know what effect the chlorinated sewage
Received from server -->would have on marine life at the discharge point.   Gargiulo said the action is not expected to cause health problems.
Received from server -->   ``The ocean is usually a hostile environment for bacteria,'' he
Received from server -->said. ``There is a high salt content and strong currents. We're veryconfident that tidal activity during the 24-hour (ban) will cleanse
Received from server -->the area.''
Received from server -->   Some beachgoers seemed equally unconcerned.   Despite red ``no swimming'' flags, Julio Armas, 26, of West Palm
Received from server -->Beach, took a blue raft into the ocean.   He said the water probably has been polluted on other days. ``We

Received from server --><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>
Received from server -->   The Reagan administration's plans for a
Received from server -->small increase in military spending may hurt efforts to get Europeanallies to pay a greater share of the common defense, analysts say.   ``This will create some tensions,'' said Hans Binnendijk,
Received from server -->director of studies for the London-based International Institute forStrategic Studies.
Received from server -->   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci asked Congress to boost defense
Received from server -->spending by an inflation-adjusted 2 percent for the next two yearsin the draft military budget. He proposed $315.2 billion in budget
Received from server -->authority for 1990, and $330.89 billion for 1991.   The spending plans, however, will likely be modified after George
Received from server -->Bush assumes the presidency.   There has been growing criticism in the U.S. Congress in recent
Received from server -->years that America's allies in the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization are not shouldering enough of the burden of financing a
Received from server -->common defense. NATO defense ministers in December released a reporton the ``burden-sharing'' issue and faulted some in the 16-nation
Received from server -->Western alliance for not doing enough.   In the late 1970s, the United States began pressing for an
Received from server -->inflation-adjusted 3 percent annual increase in each country'sdefense spending, a sum that has become a rough guideline formeasuring military expenditures.
Received from server -->   Martin McCusker, director of the military committee of the NorthAtlantic Assembly, said the draft budget plan ``will certainly bluntthe argument that some will make now _ that some Europeans are not
Received from server -->even keeping up with the minimum 3 percent.''   ``It will show the United States is not reaching that leveleither,'' he said. The assembly is made up of legislators whorepresent the NATO countries.   A spokesman for the U.S. mission to NATO said, ``Budgetaryconstraints have required the proposal for only a 2 percent
Received from server -->increase.''   ``Given the long-standing burden-sharing issue, the United Stateswould nonetheless hope that those countries which have not met past
Received from server -->goals would not use this as an excuse for lowering their budget
Received from server -->projections,'' said the spokesman, who demanded anonymity.   The NATO report on burden-sharing said that on average in the
Received from server -->past decade, Canada, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain, Turkey,Britain and the United States generally met the 3 percent goal.
Received from server -->   Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Greece posted the smallest average
Received from server -->growth levels, it said.   ``Although some countries have improved performance in the lastfive years (Canada, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Turkey and
Received from server -->the United States), performance in general has been somewhat less
Received from server -->successful and this downward trend generally seems set tocontinue,'' it said.
Received from server -->   Binnendijk said that although Carlucci wants a 2 percent pickupin military spending, ``the reality is they are not going to get any
Received from server -->real increase.''   ``Because of the budget constraints on Capitol Hill ... the best
Received from server -->the Pentagon can hope for is a straight line in real terms. Growthof 2 percent is highly unlikely,'' he said.
Received from server -->   Indeed, Congress has trimmed the Pentagon's wish list in recentyears.
Received from server -->   It approved a 1.3 percent inflation-adjusted decrease in budgetauthority in the current 1989 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The
Received from server -->administration had presented a budget proposal of $299.5 billionunder a compromise money plan worked out with Congress. That
Received from server -->proposed spending level was not large enough to offset inflation.   Congressionally approved budget authority was off 2 percent in
Received from server -->1988, 3.7 percent in 1987 and 4.4 percent in 1986. It soared 7.6
Received from server -->percent in 1985, which had marked the sixth straight year ofincreases.
Received from server -->   NATO's European members have responded to the U.S. push for moremilitary money with figures showing their total defense spending
Received from server -->skyrocketed 34 percent, after adjustment for inflation, between 1970and 1987. U.S. spending, in contrast, was up 15 percent over the
Received from server -->same period.   Per capital defense spending, according to these figures, grew 21
Received from server -->percent in the European countries over the 1970-86 period, compared
Received from server -->with a 3 percent decline in the United States. Military manpoweradvanced 5 percent in Europe over 1970-87, compared with a 31

Received from server -->   Appearing before a group of business leaders, Reagan defended his
Received from server -->budget proposal, which calls for deficit spending of $92.5 billion,as ``an excellent document that fulfills the original objectives''
Received from server -->of meeting basic needs without tax rate hikes.
Received from server -->   ``We even do this without touching Social Security, weakening our
Received from server -->national defense or reducing benefits to the needy ... and we dothis without raising taxes,'' said Reagan.   The president, who underwent weekend surgery on his left ring
Received from server -->finger, appeared with his hand heavily bandaged.
Received from server -->   Reagan said that ``thanks to our record (economic) expansion, therevenue is literally rolling in.''   ``Raising taxes would be the surest way of killing the economic
Received from server -->goose that lays the golden egg,'' the president told some 150 men
Received from server -->and women gathered in an auditorium of the Old Executive OfficeBuilding next to the White House.   Reagan and White House chief of staff Kenneth M. Duberstein told
Received from server -->the group they would not be surprised to see opposition in Congressto some of the administration's proposals for eliminating various
Received from server -->federal programs.   ``There are some people on Capitol Hill who are already saying,
Received from server -->`Dead on arrival,''' Duberstein said, ``but those people simplydon't like hearing the message that this last budget of Ronald
Received from server -->Reagan proclaims.''   Of his critics, Reagan said, ``Basically, what they really want
Received from server -->is to repudiate the last eight years and repeal the last election,''
Received from server -->in which Vice President George Bush defeated Massachusetts Gov.Michael Dukakis.
Received from server -->   Reagan again denounced what he said was an ``iron triangle'' ofcongressional Democrats, special interest groups and the news media,
Received from server -->which he predicted would be ready with ``a fiscal sob story'' aimedat undermining support for Reagan's budget.
Received from server -->   He said that critics will say that ``revenue is scare here inWashington, and there isn't enough money to go around,'' and told
Received from server -->his listeners that would be a ``flim flam story.''   Reagan said that his final budget proposal ``places America on

Received from server -->   About 1,600 passengers climbed aboard thegreen-and-white cars of the Tri-Rail commuter line Monday, eager to
Received from server -->take part in the first day of regular service on south Florida's newcommuter train.
Received from server -->   ``It's beyond our expectations,'' Broward County Commissioner Ed
Received from server -->Kennedy said of initial response to the train line, which runsbetween West Palm Beach and Miami. ``Our objective is to hold those
Received from server -->who rode it and build on that.''   Kennedy, chairman of the Tri-County Commuter Rail Organization,
Received from server -->said passenger totals should grow as communities improve busconnections and traffic worsens on Interstate 95.
Received from server -->   The 67-mile train line was born as an answer to traffic problems
Received from server -->expected during almost five years of planned construction to widenI-95 between Boca Raton and Miami.
Received from server -->   But officials hope it will become popular enough to survivebeyond that.   The federal government provided 90 percent of the $118 million
Received from server -->needed for the trains, with the state and local governments picking
Received from server -->up the rest. Federal transportation officials are carefully watchingthe project, the largest of several in the nation using existing

Received from server -->   The track record on mass transit in South Florida is not good.Metrorail, a $1 billion elevated railway system in Dade County, hasfailed to attract many riders.
Received from server -->   Commuter Bill Morgan said he was riding because ``the drivers inSouth Florida are the worst I've ever known.''
Received from server -->   Adam White, a commuter who boarded in Palm Beach County, saidriding the train ``is less stressful. You can think more ... plan

Received from server -->14,000 in three years.   He said he knew of only two problems Monday morning: a
Received from server -->malfunctioning switch that delayed a train 20 minutes; and a 20 mphspeed limit on a stretch of track in Dade County that needs to belifted.
Received from server -->   Longer range problems include an $800,000 station near the FortLauderdale airport that may be torn down because it is directlyunderneath the flight path of planes and a shortage of bus service

Received from server --><BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
Received from server --><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>
Received from server -->   President Reagan offered Congress a Pentagonbudget plan Monday that would move several big-ticket weapons into
Received from server -->production, escalate ``Star Wars'' research and largely sustain U.S.military force at its current size.
Received from server -->   Reagan requested $315.2 billion in budget authority _ a 2 percentincrease after inflation _ for national defense in fiscal 1990
Received from server -->beginning next Oct. 1. Over the past four years, Congress hastrimmed defense spending increases to levels below the rate of
Received from server -->inflation.   The defense budget envision that only $303 billion of the $315.2
Received from server -->billion will be paid out during the fiscal year. The balancerepresents money that would be authorized for various programs butnot spent until later.
Received from server -->   Of the totals, $305.6 billion in budget authority and $293.8billion in outlays is earmarked for the Defense Department. The
Received from server -->remainder _ $9.6 billion in budget authority and $9.2 billion inoutlays _ is contained in the Energy Department's budget to cover
Received from server -->nuclear warhead production and research work.
Received from server -->   Reagan's spending plan also includes recommendations for fiscal1991. He requested $330.8 billion in budget authority then, of which
Received from server -->$314.4 billion would actually be spent during the period.   President-election Bush is expected to amend Reagan's proposalafter he assumes office. Bush has talked of cutting the request so
Received from server -->that it just matches inflation instead of providing real growth.   Many of Reagan's priorities, however, are likely to be embracedby Bush. Reagan's budget, for example, increasing funds for military
Received from server -->recruiting and by proposes 3.6 percent pay raise for those inuniform, compared with only a 2 percent proposed pay raise for
Received from server -->civilian workers.
Received from server -->   The budget plan also requests $500 million to begin shutting downunneeded military bases. It would reduce the Defense Department's
Received from server -->civilian workforce of 1.1 million by 5,000 people and shift more
Received from server -->than two dozen existing weapon programs toward multi-year contracts.   Several of Reagan's defense proposals also are sure to stir
Received from server -->controversy.   For instance, Reagan wants to scrap development of the
Received from server -->truck-mobile, single-warhead Midgetman nuclear missile, a weaponfavored by some Democratic leaders in Congress.
Received from server -->   His budget also would earmark $94.6 million to start developmentof a new anti-satellite weapon that could be deployed at sea.
Received from server -->Congress forced cancellation of such a weapon that would have
Received from server -->operated from land-based jets.
Received from server -->   And Reagan would significantly boost spending on Star Warsresearch _ from $4.05 billion this year to $5.9 billion in fiscal
Received from server -->1990 and $7 billion in 1991.   Bush has said he supports Star Wars research, but it remainsunclear how fast he's willing to pursue it.   Even with the spending increase, outgoing Defense Secretary FrankC. Carlucci said the administration had made some hard choices in
Received from server -->setting priorities, either canceling or delaying two dozen programs.   Most of the affected programs were rather small, but one _ aproposal to upgrade the Navy's A-6 Intruder attack jet _ would save$503 million in fiscal 1990.
Received from server -->   ``The moderate 2 percent real growth rate proposed in this budgetis an attempt to steer a sustainable and fiscally responsible coursethat allows the United States to maintain its current force
Received from server -->structure and to acquire the weapon systems necessary to ensure our
Received from server -->national security,'' Carlucci said.   Among the major defense proposals, Reagan urged Congress to:</TEXT>
Received from server --><TEXT>
Received from server -->   _Move the new B-2 stealth bomber which unveiled just two months
Received from server -->ago into production, along with the Navy's new Trident IIsubmarine-launched nuclear missile and a rail-mobile version of the
Received from server -->giant MX intercontinental ballistic missile. Also on the nuclear, orstrategic forces, side, the fiscal 1990 budget calls for continued
Received from server -->developed of the Advanced Cruise Missile and construction of anotherTrident submarine. The Marine Corps would begin production of the
Received from server -->V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft.   _Increase active-duty personnel strength slightly by 5,000 infiscal 1990 _ up to 2,138,000 _ then adjust it back down by 4,000 infiscal 1991. The small swing is needed to help the Navy bring some
Received from server -->new ships on line, the Pentagon said. The reserve forces andNational Guard would increase in strength by 7,600 to 1,178,000.   _Allow the Navy to increase in size from 568 battle force ships
Received from server -->to 574 by the end of fiscal 1990. That number would decline slightlyto 571 by the end of 1991 with the retirement of old submarines.However, the fiscal 1990 budget also would allow the Navy to beginconstruction of 19 new ships in addition to the new Trident missilesub.
Received from server -->   _Cut from 36 to 35 the number of Tactical Air Wings in the AirForce, but maintain the existing size and structure of the Army and
Received from server -->Marine Corps. Readiness training programs would be maintained attheir current level _ Army, Navy and Air Force flying hours per
Received from server -->month and Navy steaming days would not be changed. The Army's tank
Received from server -->training budget, which allows 850 tank miles per year, would be
Received from server -->reduced slightly to 800 miles per year.
Received from server -->   _Maintain for the most part existing production rates foraircraft. The Army would build both UH-60 Blackhawk transporthelicopters and AH-64 attack choppers at the current rate of 72 a
Received from server -->year. The Marine Corps would continue to buy 24 AV-8B Harrier jets ayear, and the Air Force would continue to purchase 36 F-15 jet
Received from server -->fighters a year. The Air Force's purchases of F-16 fighters woulddecline from 180 this year to 150 in 1990, while the Navy wouldreduce its purchases of F-A-18 fighters from 84 a year to 72 a year.The Navy would increase from 12 to 18 the number of either new ormodernized F-14 fighters it buys annually.

Received from server --><TEXT>   Opposition leader Kim Young-sam said
Received from server -->Monday that President Roh Tae-woo must remove and put on trial
Received from server -->senior officials who played key roles in the authoritarian
Received from server -->government of former president Chun Doo-hwan.   Kim, leader of the Reunification Democratic Party, said South
Received from server -->Korea faces renewed political instability if the government fails to
Received from server -->expose and bring to justice all those involved in corruption andhuman rights abuses under Chun.
Received from server -->   ``We need stability. Stability can only be realized throughliquidation of past misdeeds,'' Kim said in an interview with TheAssociated Press.
Received from server -->   He said Roh must keep a promise to hold a referendum to give
Received from server -->voters the opportunity to evaluate his performance. Roh made thepromise just before the December 1987 presidential elections.   ``This is the promise he made to the people,'' Kim said.
Received from server -->   Kim said the nation would not wait indefinitely for a referendum,but he declined to set any time limits for holding the measure. Healso declined to comment on whether he thought Roh could win a
Received from server -->referendum.
Received from server -->   The government's Democratic Justice Party has said a decisionwill be made in the next few months on holding a referendum.Government officials say they are confident Roh would win a majority.
Received from server -->   Kim cast doubt on Roh's willingness to take necessary action toexpose and punish corruption and human rights abuses under Chun's
Received from server -->rule. He said top Chun aides remained in the government and rulingparty and must be expelled and put on trial.   He also insisted that former president Chun be made to testify
Received from server -->before the National Assembly inquiry into misdeeds under hisgovernment. But Kim said he opposes jailing Chun because he was oncepresident.
Received from server -->   Roh had to remove the legacy of the Chun era and proceed againstthose guilty of abuses or his government would be rejected by SouthKoreans, Kim said. ``The people would never accept or tolerate
Received from server -->anything else,'' he said.   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in
Received from server -->1980, went into rural exile in November after apologizing to thenation for abuses under his rule.   Chun accepted moral responsibility for his government's abuses,but denied he was involved. A number of Chun's relatives and aides
Received from server -->have been convicted or charged with embezzlement and other crimes.
Received from server -->   Resolving the Chun legacy is the main political challenge facingSouth Korea and it had to be resolved soon, Kim said. Failure to
Received from server -->resolve the crisis would threaten political stability, he said.
Received from server -->   The National Assembly resumes its investigation Tuesday into
Received from server -->abuses under Chun's rule. The government is attempting to blockassembly demands that Chun be made to testify before lawmakers.   Roh, a former ally of Chun, wants to limit the furor over Chun
Received from server -->without damaging his government, which is identified with hispredecessor in the eyes of many Koreans.
Received from server -->   Roh, a former general, defeated Kim Young-sam and rival

Received from server -->   Damascus Radio made no mention of those countries, but Abdullah
Received from server -->said before he left Damascus that his talks with Assad had beenaimed at bolstering Arab solidarity.   He said he discussed Syria's rifts with Morocco, Egypt and Iraq.   Syria, like most Arab states, severed links with Cairo over the

Received from server -->   The Reagan administration sought funds Monday
Received from server -->for 10 new flood control and navigation projects, including several
Received from server -->Congress refused to launch last year.
Received from server -->   It requested $88.5 million in its fiscal 1990 budget for the Army
Received from server -->Corps of Engineers projects. Six were in last year's Reagan budget,but Congress refused to start any. The four new projects are in
Received from server -->Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.   The number of new projects has slumped in recent years under thepressure of tight budgets and a 1986 law requiring local communities
Received from server -->to put up a share of the initial cost.   The budget calls for a new system of paying for maintenance on
Received from server -->the Bureau of Reclamation projects, largely bypassing thecongressional appropriations process.   For the third year in a row, the bureau, which operates in the 17
Received from server -->westernmost states of the lower 48, proposed no new construction.Sixty percent of the bureau's construction spending would be devoted
Received from server -->to three projects _ the Central Arizona Project, the Central UtahProject and the Central Valley Project in California.
Received from server -->   The budget calls for no substantial construction money for thecontroversial Garrison Diversion Unit in North Dakota until 1994,though $8.75 million would be earmarked to complete certainfacilities and secure those already built.   Similarly, the Animas-La Plata Project in Colorado and New Mexico
Received from server -->was allocated only $3.7 million to bring to a ``reasonable
Received from server -->conclusion'' pre-construction activity and equipment purchases.
Received from server -->   The bureau would spend a total of $946 million, down 14 percent
Received from server -->from $1.103 billion this year. Its construction budget would be $655million, down 7.2 percent from $706 million this year.
Received from server -->   The corps' spending would total $3.2 billion, down 1.7 percentfrom $3.26 billion. Its construction spending would total $1.22billion, up 8.9 percent from $1.12 billion.
Received from server -->   While the 10 new projects would require $85.5 million in start-upfunds, there was no estimate of how much the projects wouldultimately cost.   Congress must appropriate funds for maintaining the bureau's
Received from server -->projects, including the gigantic dams it runs in the West whosepower is sold by the power marketing administrations of the EnergyDepartment.   Some revenues from the bureau's dams and irrigation canals aretagged as owed the Treasury for operation and maintenance, butCongress must appropriate the money anyway. The bureau wants to use
Received from server -->those earmarked funds on its own.   ``As a result of the increased managerial flexibility afforded bythe revolving fund, the bureau will be better able to coordinate itsplans for the operation and maintenance of existing dams, power
Received from server -->plants and irrigation facilities,'' the budget document said. The
Received from server -->Bonneville Power Administration and the Western Area PowerAdministration ``will be full partners in approving budgets,projects and priorities.''   The budget called for spending $222 million on maintenance, up
Received from server -->from $177 million this year. But $107 million will come from the
Received from server -->revolving fund.   ``There's quite a (maintenance) backlog we have to catch up on,''
Received from server -->Interior undersecretary Earl Geljde told reporters.   Here are the 10 new Corps of Engineer projects. If two figures
Received from server -->are shown, the second figure represents the amount for constructionthe administration requested last year. An ``F'' denotes the project
Received from server -->is for flood control; an ``N'' means a navigation project.
Received from server -->   The dollar figures are in budget authority, which usually
Received from server -->approximates actual outlays during the year. Outlay figures were notimmediately available.   _Cache Creek Settling Basin, California, $5.5 million, $3.25million, F.   _Santa Ana River Mainstem, California, $20 million, $15 million,

Received from server -->   The Point Marion and Winfield projects listed construction fundsin last year's budget requests but were not shown as proposed new

Received from server --><BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>
Received from server -->   The recent discovery of a black widow binary _ astar that destroys its orbiting companion like the spider that eatsits mate _ may provide a missing link in the evolution of the
Received from server -->heavens, astronomers said Monday.   The object is a rapidly spinning binary pulsar, a dead, collapsedstar that is orbited by a larger, ordinary star.   Astronomers have discovered that the pulsar is blasting away its
Received from server -->companion in the last phase of an intricate give and take betweenthe two distant orbs.
Received from server -->   ``The companion is being destroyed,'' said Frederic A. Rasio ofCornell University. ``It is constantly losing matter. Eventually it
Received from server -->could completely disappear.''   Astronomers say it appears that the pulsar uses its companion tobuild up tremendous spinning speed, then turns on its mate, burning
Received from server -->it up.
Received from server -->   The pulsar is one of a small group of such objects that spin
Received from server -->extremely rapidly. The newly discovered pair is important because itseems to help explain how they get to spin so fast.   ``It offers a missing link between two classes of objects,'' saidSteve Maran of the Goddard Space Flight Center. ``That's why
Received from server -->astronomers are so excited.''
Received from server -->   The pulsar and its mate were discovered last spring by AndrewFruchter of the Carnegie Institution in Washington. Its implications
Received from server -->were described Monday at a meeting here of the American AstronomicalSociety.   A pulsar is an extremely dense, collapsed star made up of
Received from server -->neutrons. It is the remains of a large star that was destroyed in aspectacular explosion called a supernova.   Pulsars give off no light, but they broadcast twin rotating beams
Received from server -->of radar, like lighthouses in the sky.   A pulsar is minute compared to the sun, but its mass is 50percent greater. One teaspoon of pulsar matter weighs billions of
Received from server -->tons.
Received from server -->   Most pulsars spin about once a second and are slowing down.
Received from server -->However, the newly discovered one, known as PSR 1957-20, is one ofsix discovered so far in the Milky Way that spin much faster, inthis case about 600 times a second.   Astronomers theorize that these pulsars speed up by stealing astream of matter from a companion star. The companion ``spins up thepulsar like a top,'' said Fruchter.   However, while some of these fast-spinning pulsars have
Received from server -->companions, others do not.   ``People wondered, if you spin up the pulsar with a companion,where is the companion?'' said Fruchter. ``This may explain that.
Received from server -->The pulsar has evaporated the companion.''
Received from server -->   In the newly spotted couple, the companion is very near the
Received from server -->pulsar, just the distance of two and a half times the diameter of
Received from server -->the sun. Yet it is being bombarded with a blaze of atomic particles5,000 times more intense than the sun.
Received from server -->   ``This is the only one (mate-eating one) that we have seen in the
Received from server -->galaxy. But there is the exciting possibility that there will be
Received from server -->many more,'' said E. Sterl Phinney of California Institute ofTechnology.   Astronomers were able to study the pair because the companionregularly eclipses the pulsar. The companion revolves around the
Received from server -->pulsar once every nine hours, and each time it blocks out thepulsar's radar beam for about 50 minutes.</TEXT></DOC><DOC><DOCNO> AP890109-0186 </DOCNO>

Received from server -->looking at what is going on now, what is being said and done _ thisis nothing. It is terrible.''
Received from server -->   Mrs. Walesa said she sees the government involved in a
Received from server -->``psychological struggle to mentally destroy people.''
Received from server -->   But she said, ``People don't let themselves be tread on. Not inthese times.''   Mrs. Walesa went to Oslo in 1983 to receive the Nobel Peace Prize

Received from server -->   She called the trip ``a beautiful challenge'' and described other``nice experiences, even lofty'' as the wife of the leader of the
Received from server -->Polish opposition.
Received from server -->   But she recalled with bitterness the imposition of martial law in
Received from server -->December 1981, when Walesa began 11 months of internment and hisunion was outlawed.
Received from server -->   ``My martial law started in March (1982),'' said Mrs. Walesa,
Received from server -->when her daughter, Maria, was to have been baptized. She said shesought permission for her husband to attend but an official told herthe day before that her petition had been rejected.

Received from server -->   That would cost you 50 cents or a dollar under the budgetproposals Ronald Reagan submitted to Congress Monday for the lasttime in his presidency.   On page 4-15, it pops up: ``a user fee on taypayer telephoneinformation services is proposed for 1991'' with design work and
Received from server -->trial runs to be done in the interlude.   In scores of small ways, people would get less from thegovernment or pay more for what they get under the proposals thepresident submitted.   Fend for yourself is the general theme of Reagan's final budget,one sure to be modified by George Bush when he takes office Jan. 20
Received from server -->and to be looked upon skeptically by the Democratic-controlledCongress.
Received from server -->   Congress, in fact, already has seen _ and rejected _ many of
Received from server -->Reagan's economizing proposals. He offered them up again Monday,anyway.   Costs would go up or benefits down for boat owners, veterans withslightly disabling war injuries, commuters, air travelers, federalretirees, doctors, people who lose their jobs to foreign competition
Received from server -->and middle-class kids who eat subsidized lunches at school.
Received from server -->   Reagan noted that even students at ``high tuition private schoolscan get meal subsidies'' and proposed to eliminate all 40-centlunches for kids from families well above the poverty line. The
Received from server -->costs would go up by about 26 cents unless the states or local
Received from server -->school districts made up the difference.
Received from server -->   For the homeless, the news could be better: Reagan proposed aprogram under which the government would buy enough food to provide
Received from server -->food kitchens and food banks with 256 million meals.
Received from server -->   And for federal prisoners, Reagan called for ``an aggressive
Received from server -->prison building program'' to cut overcrowding, now put at 60 percent.
Received from server -->   But military veterans with service-connected injuries that givethem disability ratings of 20 percent or less would have to look to
Received from server -->private health insurance for their care in veterans' hospitals. Thegovernment now pays.
Received from server -->   The 34 million Americans who ride Amtrak would have to turnelsewhere for transportation.   Reagan proposed _ not for the first time _ to blow the whistle onthe railroad and find a customer for its Northeast Corridor service.
Received from server -->It would be cheaper to hand an air or bus ticket to every Amtrakpassenger, he said, than to pay a subsidy averaging $30 perpassenger.   Reagan called, too, for eliminating subsidies that help runsubways and bus services and terminating a program that keeps air
Received from server -->service for many small communities.   Doctors would have to accept smaller fees for treating theelderly under Medicare and the poor under Medicaid. Radiologists,
Received from server -->anesthesiologists and surgeons especially would get less.   The nation's six million boat owners _ weekend sailors andcommercial fishermen alike _ would have to buy a $25 Coast Guard
Received from server -->decal to help defray the costs of rescues in emergencies.   Homebuyers would see a nearly four-fold increase in the 1 percent
Received from server -->fee for VA loan guarantees. It would rise to 3.8 percent underReagan's proposals.
Received from server -->   He proposed eliminating the 1990 cost-of-living increase inpensions received by federal retirees and reworking the formula
Received from server -->under which COLA increases are granted so that the retired workers
Received from server -->would have to absorb the first 1 percent increase in the annual costof living.
Received from server -->   Workers who lose their jobs to foreign competition now get weekly
Received from server -->benefits while they look for other work. Reagan proposed eliminatinga program which he said works ``to benefit one group ofunderemployed workers or uncompetitive firms.''

Received from server -->   Gadhafi has offered the United States a one-time inspection of

Received from server --><TEXT>   Libya said Monday the United States has launched a``vile campaign'' against it with allegations over a chemicalweapons plant, and accused Washington of helping Israel stockpilenuclear, chemical and biological arms.
Received from server -->   Foreign Minister Jadalah Azouz Ettalhi, speaking at aninternational conference on chemical weapons, dismissed U.S. chargesthat Libya has a chemical weapons plant as ``clearly false.''
Received from server -->   The Libyan minister mentioned the United States only once by name_ to condemn the downing of two Libyan jet fighters last week _ and
Received from server -->referred to Israel as the ``racist Zionist entity.''   He urged the international community to condemn the incident Jan.

Received from server -->has said its action was in self-defense.
Received from server -->   Charges that Israel has nuclear weapons are at the heart of a
Received from server -->campaign by Arab states to link bans on nuclear and chemical arms.The issue has stymied progress on a final communique to be issued
Received from server -->Wednesday at the close of the five-day conference.
Received from server -->   Ettalhi said the U.S. position on chemical weapons wasdiscriminatory.   The United States and the Soviet Union admit to having largestockpiles of chemical weapons _ the only two countries to make such
Received from server -->an admission of about 20 nations presumed to possess the weapons.
Received from server -->   There is a widespread fear that nations without a nuclearcapability will stock chemical arms.   ``How can any member of the international community proclaim aright it denies others,'' Ettalhi said, ``while at the same time
Received from server -->launching a vile campaign of calumny on the basis of adiscriminatory, racist position?''
Received from server -->   ``Agreed international rules must be applied to all partieswithout discrimination,'' the Libyan minister said.   Earlier Monday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze toldreporters that evidence presented to him by Secretary of State
Received from server -->George Shultz on the alleged chemical weapons plant at Rabta, southof the Libyan capital of Tripoli, did not prove anything.
Received from server -->   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, also attending theconference, charged Monday that Iraq, Syria and Libya _ three bitterfoes of Israel _ have chemical arms and represent ``a direct
Received from server -->threat.''   U.S. arms control official Lynn Hansen, asked about Libya'scharge that Israel has nuclear weapons and that the United States
Received from server -->helped it obtain them, said: ``I'm not going to get down and grovelwith the Libyans about this or that.''   Israel has never responded directly to allegations it has nuclearweapons, saying only it will not be the first country to introducesuch weapons into the Middle East.   Britain joined the United States on Monday in rejecting a link
Received from server -->between nuclear and chemical weapons bans.   Ettalhi's speech was widely regarded as subdued in a conference
Received from server -->that has seen outbursts and public disputes since it began Saturday.   Most delegates walked out of the conference hall before a speech
Received from server -->earlier Monday by South African Foreign Minister R.F. Botha.
Received from server -->   Hansen, head of the bureau of multilateral affairs at the U.S.
Received from server -->arms control agency, called the conference ``positive'' but admitteddifficulty in reaching a consensus on the final statement.
Received from server -->   The conference is aimed at reaffirming the only existing
Received from server -->international document on chemical weapons _ the 1925 GenevaProtocol banning their use _ and pressing for a global,
Received from server -->comprehensive ban.   Iraq's known use of chemical weapons in its eight-year war withIran has served as a macabre backdrop for delegates. A top U.S.
Received from server -->expert, speaking on condition of anonymity, said evidence shows thatIraq was the chief producer of chemical arms among Arab nations,followed by Syria. He said he had no information on Israel.   A conference source said the final statement would necessarilyhave to accommodate the demands of the Arab nations.
Received from server -->   The statement ``will have to take into account the preoccupationsof certain Arab countries,'' said the source, speaking on conditionof anonymity. ``But it is a bit too early to say what form that willtake.''
Received from server -->   A working version of the final statement obtained by The
Received from server -->Associated Press made no direct reference to linking nuclear andchemical arms. But it referred to the need to obtain ``general andcomplete disarmament.''   It called on each state here to ``exercise restraint and act
Received from server -->responsibly'' on the issue of chemical arms until a convention
Received from server -->banning use, production and stocking of chemical weapons is reached.   The final document will be of a political nature with no
Received from server -->enforcement power. But it is meant to pressure negotiators in Genevato overcome obstacles in talks that have languished for nearly adecade.   The Geneva convention would ban use, production and stockpilingof chemical arms by all nations, but negotiators have failed to
Received from server -->reach agreement on such major issues as verification.

Received from server --><TEXT>   President-elect Bush bestowed cautious praise
Received from server -->on President Reagan's parting budget Monday, saying he ``agrees with
Received from server -->its intent'' while making clear he will develop his own proposals.
Received from server -->   ``I will continue to review it for possible amendments after Iassume the office of the presidency,'' Bush said in a succinctwritten statement on the $1.15 trillion spending plan Reagan sent toCongress for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
Received from server -->   Bush also said he will have nothing further to say on his ownbudget plans until after he takes office on Jan. 20.   Craig Fuller, a senior Bush aide, read the vice president's
Received from server -->budget statement at a briefing but declined to elaborate upon it.   He said the vice president ``has not made any final determinationabout what shape (his) budget document, or framework, orpresentation'' will take. Fuller said Reagan's budget showed thatwhat Bush had talked about during his campaign, meeting
Received from server -->deficit-reduction targets without raising taxes or disturbing SocialSecurity ``is do-able.''   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady _ whom Bush has asked to stay
Received from server -->on _ told reporters that ``work is actively under way'' on Bush'sbudget modifications.   ``It is certainly possible that much of the current budget willremain on the table, although it is too early at this stage to offer
Received from server -->more specific details,'' Brady said.   Brady also said that Reagan's budget, by proposing the legallyrequired deficit reduction without seeking higher taxes, meets agoal ``fully shared by President-elect Bush.''
Received from server -->   The vice president, in his statement, said that Reagan's farewell
Received from server -->budget ``is an excellent budget which demonstrates clearly that thetargets set under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law can be met and
Received from server -->indeed exceeded without raising taxes.   ``Naturally, I support its intent,'' he added.
Received from server -->   The deficit law calls for a fiscal 1990 deficit of no more than$100 billion. The new Reagan budget projects a deficit _ assuming
Received from server -->adoption of all its elements _ of $92.8 billion for 1990, down froman estimated $161.5 billion deficit in the current fiscal year.
Received from server -->   During his campaign, Bush advocated what he called a ``flexiblefreeze'' on federal spending. The concept calls for holding the
Received from server -->increase in overall spending at the annual rate of inflation _currently running at about 4.4 percent.   Any proposed additional increases would have to be offset by
Received from server -->corresponding decreases in other programs _ except that SocialSecurity benefits would not be touched.
Received from server -->   Bush will have to find room in the Reagan budget outline for theincreases in spending needed for the ``kinder, gentler nation''
Received from server -->programs he proposed in his campaign _ including expected increases
Received from server -->for education, child care, expansion of the government's Head Start
Received from server -->program and enviromental cleanup.   And, even though Reagan's budget appears to smooth the way forsome of these modifications, in some cases the document appears atodds with Bush's campaign statements.   For instance, Bush has proposed an increase of Medicaid to help
Received from server -->cover medical expenses for poor pregnant women and their babies.
Received from server -->Reagan, in the new budget, has proposed over $1 billion in Medicaid
Received from server -->reductions.
Received from server -->   Reagan's budget again calls for austerity in social programs and
Received from server -->would eliminate 82 programs. At the same time, the plan would
Received from server -->protect his defense buildup by advocating a 2 percent increase indefense spending authority above inflation.
Received from server -->   Congressional budget writers have said they expect defensespending may be one of the areas Bush looks at most closely as he
Received from server -->seeks to find offsetting reductions to make his ``flexibile freeze''
Received from server -->work.   Both he and incoming Defense Secretary John Tower have talked
Received from server -->publicly about the need for more defense economies, particularly in
Received from server -->the area of troop strength.   Bush aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the
Received from server -->vice president did not want to upstage the president on Monday byreacting at length to the budget document.
Received from server -->   ``Naturally, he agrees with its intent. And, naturally, he'llhave his own recommendations, or put forth potential amendments,once he takes office,'' said one senior transition official.   ``But he won't be presenting any of those recommendations untilhe's prepared to present all of them to the Congress, whatever time
Received from server -->that might be,'' the official added.</TEXT></DOC><DOC><DOCNO> AP890109-0191 </DOCNO><FILEID>AP-NR-01-09-89 2011EST</FILEID>

Received from server --><TEXT>
Received from server -->   Tens of thousands of workers in eastern
Received from server -->Hungary staged a 10-minute warning strike Monday against big priceincreases, and trade unions charged the government is ``picking thepockets'' of the people.   The state news agency MTI reported workers in Szabolcs-Szatmarcounty started work with a 10-minute delay and said local tradeunion leaders supported their action.   MTI estimated the increases that took effect Monday will cost
Received from server -->consumers $15 a month, and predicted food consumption will drop 10percent to 15 percent in the first half of the year.
Received from server -->   ``Behind these stark sets of figures there are human lives,''
Received from server -->Nepszava, the official trade union daily, said in a Monday editorial.   Trade union leaders already have warned the increases could sparkstrikes.   According to the Nepszava, 10 percent of families in Hungary live
Received from server -->on a smaller monthly income than the official subsistence level of
Received from server -->$72.
Received from server -->   Inflation amounted to 17 percent in 1988, when real wages droppedby 8 percent, according to official statistics.   ``The characteristic feature of the government's financial policy
Received from server -->will be picking the pockets of the companies and the population,''Nepszava charged.
Received from server -->   Hungarian officials Monday told journalists the price rises were
Received from server -->needed to reduce state subsidies and balance the budget. They arepart of a series of economic reforms and austerity measures thegovernment is introducing to help reduce Hungary's $17 billion
Received from server -->foreign debt and stimulate the stagnating economy.
Received from server -->   Trade union leaders support the idea of allowing the market to
Received from server -->regulate prices, but admonished the government to apply these rules
Received from server -->also to wages.
Received from server -->   ``On what ground does the government believe that labor can bebought for less than it costs?'' the paper asked. ``No order, nostabilization can possibly emerge until honest work is paid byhonest wages.''   Other increases planned this year include raising publictransportation costs by 62 percent Feb. 1 and household water andsewage fees by 220 percent to 290 percent March 1.
Received from server -->   In Budapest and elsewhere, citizens anticipated the price hikesby stockpiling, leaving food shop shelves completely bare last week.   Prices of pork, poultry and meat preparations went up by 13

Received from server --><TEXT>   U.S. and Japanese banks may agree topay part of the Philippines' $28 billion foreign debt if Manilaallows U.S. bases to remain here, the Philippine ambassador to
Received from server -->Washington said Monday.   Two visiting U.S. senators, meanwhile, pledged to persuade their

Received from server -->The agreement, signed by Filipino and American negotiators inOctober, needs congressional approval.
Received from server -->   Ambassador Emmanuel Pelaez told reporters that he had received
Received from server -->``feelers'' on the ``debt-for-bases'' deal from Japanese andAmerican financiers who are ``proposing it as a straight commercial
Received from server -->deal.''
Received from server -->   He did not give further details.   Pelaez said the International Monetary Fund and the World Bankprobably would support such a deal as a way to ensure political and
Received from server -->economic stability in the Philippines.   The United States has six installations in the Philippines,
Received from server -->including Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay naval base. The lease onthe installations expires in 1991, and President Corazon Aquino hasrefused to say whether she will support an extension.
Received from server -->   Pelaez said that closing the bases could ``lead to politicalupheavals.''   Also on Monday, Sens. Richard Lugar. R-Ind., and Thad Cochran,R-Miss., said they were pleased with progess in the Philippinessince 1986, when they visited the country to observe an election

Received from server -->   The case that sparked the movie``Mississippi Burning'' involving the 1964 slayings of three civilrights workers could be reopened, but the district attorney does notplan to give it special attention.   ``There's no statute of limitations on murder, so it could be
Received from server -->prosecuted,'' said Neshoba County District Attorney Ken Turner.   But Turner said he was not aware of any new evidence, andindicated he had no special interest in prosecuting the case.
Received from server -->   ``I'm interested in prosecuting any murder case. I wouldn't
Received from server -->single this case out,'' Turner said. ``We can't prosecute on
Received from server -->emotion.''
Received from server -->   The slayings of Andrew Goodman, James Chaney and Michael
Received from server -->Schwerner on June 21, 1964, have received renewed attention as a
Received from server -->result of publicity surrounding the release of ``Mississippi
Received from server -->Burning,'' which uses the deaths near Philadelphia as the basis for
Received from server -->a fictitious story on the turbulent civil rights era.
Received from server -->   The three civil rights workers were killed by a Ku Klux Klangroup shortly after they arrived in Mississippi. The FBI found their
Received from server -->bodies buried in an earthen dam in the county 44 days after thekillings.
Received from server -->   Eight men were convicted on federal charges in 1967 of conspiringto deprive the three of their civil rights. Mississippi neverbrought murder charges in the case.
Received from server -->   ``I think it was a tragic time in Mississippi history,'' said
Received from server -->state Attorney General Mike Moore. ``What we should all remember isthat it's been 25 or so years. The Mississippi we have today is amuch different, brighter, much more intelligent place to live.''
Received from server -->   Moore said a decision to prosecute rested with Turner.   Turner was in meetings Monday with a grand jury and had notreturned calls from The Associated Press seeking additional comment.
Received from server -->Neshoba County NAACP Chairman Pete Talley of Philadelphia was out oftown and not available for comment.   W.H. Johnson of Decatur, who was district attorney from 1964-72,
Received from server -->said that at the time the ``state government didn't trust the
Received from server -->federal government, and the federal government didn't trust thestate government.'' He said he presented the slayings before a grandjury three times without success.
Received from server -->   ``I felt it should be tried at the local level, but you had to
Received from server -->have indictments to do it,'' he said.   Six weeks after the bodies were found, a Neshoba County grandjury was impaneled and subpoenas were issued to FBI agents. However,
Received from server -->FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover told a circuit judge his agents wouldnot disclose any information.
Received from server -->   FBI agents said they didn't turn over information because they
Received from server -->had to protect their sources from possible violence.   In its report, the grand jury said its investigation had been``curtailed, and in fact stymied, by the failure and refusal ofagents'' to testify.   The county grand jury in September 1964 defended local law
Received from server -->enforcement officials, saying they had done ``an exceptional job ofmaintaining law and order in this county, even in the face ofdrastic provocation....''
Received from server -->   But retired agent Joseph Sullivan, who led the FBI investigation   into the murders, had another view of the case.      ``Neshoba was an incredibly closed and racist county,'' he said
Received from server -->recently. ``The county's law enforcement officers knew what was
Received from server -->happening, the blacks and Indians in the county were almost supine,and practically none of the whites in Philadelphia would cooperate
Received from server -->with us in solving the case; we found that almost every adult whitemale in the county had connections with the Ku Klux Klan.''
Received from server -->   When the state of Mississippi failed to indict anyone in thecase, the federal government stepped in and charged 18 men with
Received from server -->conspiring to violate the victims' civil rights. Eventually, eight
Received from server -->were convicted and given sentences ranging from three to 10 years.</TEXT></DOC>

Received from server --><DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A jury was selected Monday to hear thelong-delayed trial of three avowed revolutionaries accused ofplotting to overthrow the government.
Received from server -->   It took 68 days in court to select jurors in a case that hasalready cost more than $3 million. Both sides predict the trial willlast a year, even with the number of defendants whittled from eightto three. Opening arguments were set for Tuesday.
Received from server -->   The three face charges of seditious conspiracy, or plotting totopple the government by force; racketeering conspiracy; and
Received from server -->racketeering enterprise. They each face up to 60 years in prison and$60,000 in fines if convicted.
Received from server -->   Up to 350 witnesses could be called to testify. Observers mustpass through two metal detectors to reach the courtroom, which an
Received from server -->estimated 40 marshals take turns guarding.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Loucks will present the
Received from server -->government's case against the defendants, whom he calls
Received from server -->``terrorists.''   Loucks has alleged in court documents that the defendants aredangerous members of an underground group that conspired to robbanks and carry out at least 19 bombings, including an explosionthat rocked the Suffolk County Courthouse in 1976 and severed a
Received from server -->man's leg. The bombings injured 21 others.   The indictment also alleges that the defendants plotted the 1981murder of a New Jersey state trooper and two attempted murders inMassachusetts and Maine.   Defendant Raymond Luc Levasseur, 42, of Maine, will represent
Received from server -->himself, and attorneys will represent Levasseur's wife, PatriciaGros Levasseur, 40, and Richard Williams, 41, of Boston.
Received from server -->   The defendants have maintained that what the prosecution
Received from server -->describes as terrorism is actually resistance to imperialisticpolicies of the U.S. government in Central America and other places.   Their attorneys have argued against the dangers of the seditiousconspiracy statute that makes it a crime to carry out plots to putdown or destroy the government. They maintain that the statute isvague and so broad that it could be used to prosecute such minor
Received from server -->acts of civil disobedience as protests outside military
Received from server -->installations.
Received from server -->   ``What's at stake here is not just the rights of the people ontrial, it's the rights of every American,'' William Newman, whorepresents Mrs. Levasseur, said Monday.
Received from server -->   All but five of the 17 jurors were picked at one fell swoop
Received from server -->Monday from a prescreened group of 45. Jury selection began inApril. Attorneys depleted the jury pool before they could pick thealternates to sit with the panel of 12 jurors.   After the jurors were seated, U.S. District Judge William G.
Received from server -->Young explained the charges and asked them to suspend judgment untilthe evidence had been presented.
Received from server -->   ``The government has to prove somebody actually did something tomake a conspiracy come about,'' he said. ``On no account can aperson be prosecuted for his political beliefs.''   The three defendants are all that remain of the eight who were
Received from server -->arrested in Ohio, Virginia and Massachusetts, most of them in 1984,in what the prosecution has called the largest manhunt since the
Received from server -->Lindbergh kidnapping.
Received from server -->   Charges were dropped in August against two of the defendants _Thomas W. Manning, 42, of Maine, and Jaan Karl Laaman, 40, of East
Received from server -->Boston _ because they were already serving long sentences.   Manning's wife, Carol, 33, pleaded guilty this month, and Young
Received from server -->decided last week to hold a separate trial for Laaman's wife,Barbara J. Curzi-Laaman, 31.
Received from server -->   One other defendant, Christopher King, 38, has been triedseparately and found guilty on the single count of seditious
Received from server -->conspiracy. He was sentenced to seven years in prison.</TEXT>

Received from server -->   At least 80 people have been killed and 200 wounded as theembattled villages changed hands in house-to-house combat betweenthe mainstream Amal militia and fundamentalist Hezbollah since
Received from server -->daybreak Sunday, said police.
Received from server -->   It was the highest 36-hour toll since the power struggle began inApril to dominate Lebanon's 1 million Shiites, the largest sect in
Received from server -->this nation of 4 million. Nearly 500 people have been killed and1,500 injured in the confrontation.   A police spokesman in Sidon, south Lebanon's provincial capital,said fighters are committing ``horrific atrocities.'   ``They're knifing, hacking and gunning each other to death in
Received from server -->Kfar Filla and Jbaa,'' he said.   ``Many victims have been hacked to death in Kfar Melki, Kfar
Received from server -->Hatta and Kfar Beit. Others had their throats cut and some wereheadless. Many were riddled with bullets,'' said the spokesman, who
Received from server -->cannot be identified under standing regulations.
Received from server -->   Amal and Hezbollah accused each other of ``atrocities and summaryexecutions.''
Received from server -->   Amal, Arabic for ``Hope,'' launched a counterattack before dawn
Received from server -->Monday and retook three of five villages seized by Hezbollah in a
Received from server -->lightning onslaught Sunday in south Lebanon's Iklim el-Tiffah, orApple Province.   Reporters who drove into the battle area, near Israel's
Received from server -->self-designated ``security zone,'' said fierce fighting is raging
Received from server -->for the two other villages.   The chain of hamlets lies along the main road from Sidon port, 25miles south of Beirut, to the Israeli-held border enclave.
Received from server -->   Reporters said Amal drove Hezbollah out of the battered villagesof Kfar Hatta, Kfar Melki and Kfar Beit in hand-to-hand fighting.   An Amal commander in Kfar Melki said about 1,000 of his men used
Received from server -->Syrian-supplied T-54 tanks to attack Kfar Filla and Jbaa, where 500
Received from server -->Hezbollah members are holed up.   ``The battle for liberation will continue until the Hezbollah
Received from server -->cancer is uprooted from the whole of south Lebanon,'' said commanderMohammed Ghossein.
Received from server -->   Amal said in a late night communique in Beirut that its fighters
Received from server -->recaptured Kfar Filla and were mopping up the last pockets ofresistance in Jbaa. The Sidon police spokesman said he could notconfirm this.   The roar of multibarreled rocket launchers and tank fire boomedacross hills and valleys from Kfar Filla and Jbaa as reporters
Received from server -->watched from a distance.   Cars hit by rocket-propelled grenades smoldered in the streets ofKfar Hatta and Kfar Melki, whose 8,000 inhabitants spent the night
Received from server -->hiding in apple orchards and olive groves.   ``They've burned my house, but God has burned them in Amal'swrath!'' screamed Aisha Barhoum, a 35-year-old Shiite woman whofound her one-story house in Kfar Melki gutted.
Received from server -->   ``We've been liberated from Hezbolshaitan,'' she said, making a
Received from server -->pun with the Arabic for ``Party of Satan'' on Hezbollah's name,
Received from server -->which means ``Party of God.''   Kfar Beit was almost deserted. Only two dozen of its 1,000
Received from server -->residents were seen; the rest apparently had fled.
Received from server -->   Iran and Syria, Tehran's main Arab ally in Iran's war againstIraq, have been trying to rein in their feuding Lebanese proxiesdespite differing interests in Lebanon.   Ali Mohammed Besharati, Iran's first deputy foreign minister,
Received from server -->left Tehran on Monday for Syria to mediate between leaders of the
Received from server -->warring factions, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.   Hezbollah wants to establish an Islamic republic in Lebanon
Received from server -->fashioned after Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime.
Received from server -->The more secular Amal is aligned with neighboring Syria, a secularstate.   Police said Amal and Hezbollah gunners were locked in artillery
Received from server -->duels around other south Lebanon villages.   In Tyre, south of Sidon, police said Amal militiamen rounded up150 Hezbollah partisans in overnight house raids in the city andsurrounding villages.   Syrian troops patrolled Beirut in the residential districts of
Received from server -->Noweiri and Bourj Abu Haidar where Amal and Hezbollah clashed for
Received from server -->two hours Sunday.
Received from server -->   Hezbollah's Sunday offensive in the south marked a comeback by

Received from server --><TEXT>   Troops shot and wounded 26 Palestinians duringclashes Monday, Arab reports said, as a general strike ordered by
Received from server -->Islamic fundamentalists and PLO-backed leaders closed down theoccupied territories.   The worst clash erupted in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in theoccupied Gaza Strip, where Israeli soldiers opened fire onstone-throwing youths and wounded 11, Arab reporters said.
Received from server -->   Ten Palestinians were admitted to Nasser Hospital near the camp,including a 5-year-old boy with a gunshot wound in the right leg,
Received from server -->doctors said. A 27-year-old Palestinian involved in the clash
Received from server -->underwent emergency surgery at Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City for
Received from server -->removal of a bullet in the chest, the hospital said.   Four Palestinians also were shot in the Farah refugee camp near
Received from server -->Nablus, including two teen-agers in critical condition with bullet
Received from server -->wounds to their stomachs, Palestinian doctors said.   Army spokesmen confirmed 16 wounded, included four in Farah, two
Received from server -->in Khan Yunis and one in the Gaza Strip town of Rafah. The
Received from server -->spokesman, who cannot be identified under military rules, said hewas checking further.   A 35-year-old Palestinian woman suspected of collaborating with
Received from server -->Israeli authorities was stabbed repeatedly by four masked Arabs who
Received from server -->broke into her home, Arab reporters and doctors said.   They said the woman, a teacher from the West Bank village of
Received from server -->Hable, survived the attack and was hospitalized.   The army said it had no report of a stabbing in Hable.
Received from server -->   Also Monday, 63 people were arrested after a violent protestoutside the Megiddo prison in northern Israel where manyPalestinians are detained, Israel television said.
Received from server -->   The clash began when seven members of an Israeli group called``Stop the Occupation'' demonstrated outside the prison to protestconditions of imprisonment, the report said.
Received from server -->   Demonstrators refused orders by troops to leave, and were removed
Received from server -->by force. At this point, relatives of prisoners waiting outside the
Received from server -->Megiddo gates started throwing stones and bottles at security forceswho fired tear gas, the report said.
Received from server -->   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told the president of
Received from server -->the European Parliament, Lord Plumb, that the European Community was
Received from server -->siding too much with the Palestinians to play an active role in thepeace process, Israel media said.   Shamir also gave Plumb a message for Jordan in which he urgedIsrael's neighbor to become more involved in the process. Plumb is
Received from server -->on a two-day official visit to Israel.   Israeli settlers blocked a main West Bank highway and stoned
Received from server -->Palestinian cars after a resident of the Arab village of Kafr Nakif
Received from server -->hurled a firebomb at an Israeli car the night before, Palestiniannews reports said.   They said 15 Arab cars were damaged on the highway connecting
Received from server -->Nablus with Qalqilya. The army confirmed the firebombing, whichcaused no injuries or damage, but said it had no information on thesettlers' roadblock.
Received from server -->   The daily Haaretz reported Monday that Defense Minister Yitzhak
Received from server -->Rabin had renewed secret contacts with Palestinians on convening
Received from server -->municipal elections in the occupied territories for the first time
Received from server -->since 1976.   The meetings at Rabin's Tel Aviv office were held in secret toprotect Arab participants from attacks by Palestinian nationalists,the newspaper said.   In a leaflet issued Monday, the Palestine LiberationOranization-backed leadership of the uprising rejected Israeli moves
Received from server -->for elections and called for escalation of the 13-month-old
Received from server -->Palestinian revolt, in which at least 348 Palestinians and 15Israelis have been killed.   ``Our heroic people, we are convinced that your struggle willdefeat the terrorist (Prime Minister Yitzhak) Shamir, who is trying
Received from server -->to end the uprising by holding elections to try to find anotherleadership than our representative, the PLO,'' said the leaflet.
Received from server -->   The leaflet also called for a general strike Monday to coincidewith a call issued earlier by the Islamic fundamentalist group,Hamas.
Received from server -->   Hamas supporters warned merchants against disobeying the strikecall. Red-painted graffiti in Nablus said: ``Any merchant who openshis shop will find it torched to the ground.''</TEXT>

Received from server --><HEAD>Reagan Again Wants Sharp Farm Cuts in Budget Critics Call Irrelevant</HEAD><BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
Received from server --><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>
Received from server -->   President Reagan proposed on Monday to cutspending by the Agriculture Department in fiscal 1990 by 19 percent,
Received from server -->including sharp reductions for commodity programs, rural housing andemergency disaster aid to farmers.
Received from server -->   Another proposal would eliminate federal school lunch subsidies
Received from server -->for children of middle and upper income families, requiring them topay 26 cents more per meal. The savings would amount to more than $3
Received from server -->million a day.   Under the proposed budget to operate USDA in the year that willbegin Oct. 1, total spending would be held to $42.4 billion, down
Received from server -->from the estimated outlays of $52.1 billion in the current fiscal
Received from server -->year.   ``As has been anticipated, this budget is largely irrelevant,''
Received from server -->said Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate AgricultureCommittee. ``It might, of course, have been designed to make a Bushbudget appear kinder and gentler.''
Received from server -->   Spending on the department's Commodity Credit Corp. programs,which includes wheat, corn and other major crop supports, woulddecline to a six-year low of less than $11.6 billion billion from
Received from server -->more than $13.8 billion in 1989. The peak was $25.8 billion in 1986.   The budget for CCC spending included $1.1 billion of unspecified
Received from server -->cuts that would be decided by the incoming Bush administration and
Received from server -->Congress. Future spending reductions in CCC programs could be in therange of $2 billion to $2.5 billion annually for 1991 through 1994.
Received from server -->   Leahy said the Reagan blueprint for cutting farm programs raisesa question of whether the administration ``actually means to disarm
Received from server -->unilaterally just two months before the next round of trade talks.''
Received from server -->   The administration has urged under the General Agreement on
Received from server -->Tariffs and Trade that all subsidies and other practices thatinterfere with free trade be eliminated, but the idea hasn't caught
Received from server -->on.   ``Cutting farm programs before obtaining an agreement from ourtrading partners to do the same seems likely to undermine our GATT
Received from server -->negotiating position,'' Leahy said in a statement.   Deputy Secretary Peter Myers said no legislation to carry out theCCC proposal would be sent to Congress at this time.
Received from server -->   ``We're not going to be that presumptive,'' Myers said. ``We'regoing to say, `Congress, here's a way you can cut $1.1 billion. Doyou want to wrestle with it?' We think the Bush administrationshould have the perogative to look at it. It's a recommendation.It's an option.''   The Reagan budget proposal for operating CCC's farm programswould include a 5 percent reduction in target prices beginning withthe 1990 crops, and slightly larger cuts the following three years.Target prices are used to compute federal payments to farmers whenmarket prices fall short.
Received from server -->   Robert A. Denman, director of international and public affairsfor the National Farmers Union, said most recent Reagan budgetproposals ``have been dead on arrival'' when sent to Congress,
Received from server -->anyway.   The proposed 5 percent cut in crop target prices for 1990 on topof reductions already specified by the 1985 farm law may be part of
Received from server -->the Reagan budget plan but Denman hoped that ``it wouldn't
Received from server -->necessarily be in a Bush budget.''   ``This budget is not drastically different from previous Reagan
Received from server -->budgets,'' USDA budget director Stephen B. Dewhurst said. ``The
Received from server -->basic position taken on farm programs is that we're spending too
Received from server -->much money on them.''   In many other respects, the 1990 budget proposals for USDA
Received from server -->represent a continuation of Reagan administration policies,including some that had been rejected by Congress in the past.
Received from server -->   For example, the 1990 budget seeks to eliminate school lunch
Received from server -->subsidies for non-needy children. Needy children would continuegetting free or reduced-price meals.
Received from server -->   But a child from a family having an income of more than 185percent of the official poverty line _ $21,553 a year for a family
Received from server -->of four _ would have to pay about 26 cents more per day at theschool cafeteria, unless the states or local districts made up the
Received from server -->difference.
Received from server -->   Overall food and consumer services, which take almost half of theUSDA's annual budget, would remain mostly intact, however. Totalspending would be almost $20.6 billion, down from $21.3 billion this
Received from server -->year. Food stamps, which serve more than 18 million people, areexpected to cost about $12.7 billion, compared with almost $12.9
Received from server -->billion currently.   A report by department budget analysts showed that spending for
Received from server -->small community and rural development would be chopped by nearlytwo-thirds _ from $9.4 billion this year to $3.4 billion in fiscal1990. Existing housing loans and grants, at a spending level of
Received from server -->$3.36 billion this year, would be terminated in favor of a housingvoucher program.   Farm loans of the Farmers Home Administration would be reduced to$3.7 billion from $4.9 billion this year and ``will continue theshift from direct loans to guaranteed loans'' established by the
Received from server -->1985 farm law, the report said. Guaranteed operating loans areexpected to increase to $2.8 billion from $2.6 billion this year.   But FmHA disaster loans, reflecting hoped-for better weather
Received from server -->conditions, are expected to decline to around $50 million from $600million this year.   The budget report said FmHA will continue to help farm borrowers
Received from server -->reschedule overdue loans so they can stay in business. However, manyhave gone under and the FmHA currently holds almost 5,000 farms in
Received from server -->its inventory with a market value of about $650 million.   Some increases were called for in a number of USDA programs,including research and education, soil and water conservation, and
Received from server -->food safety and inspection services.   Also, the administration seeks $250 million in supplementalfinancing this fiscal year to help the Forest Service pay for
Received from server -->firefighting. A new plan was outlined to partially pay forfirefighting in the future by using money collected from timbersales and mining on federal lands.

Received from server --><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Navy said Monday it has selected the
Received from server -->General Dynamics Corp. as the lead contractor on its next class ofnuclear-powered attack submarine, the SSN-21 Seawolf.
Received from server -->   General Dynamics' victory over arch-rival Newport NewsShipbuilding and Drydock Co. came despite the fact that Newport News
Received from server -->earlier had won the lead contract for designing the hull of the newsub.
Received from server -->   General Dynamics has been designing the nuclear propulsion systemfor the new boat.
Received from server -->   The Navy said Monday it was awarding General Dynamics' ElectricBoat Division in Groton, Conn., a $726 million
Received from server -->``fixed-price-incentive contract'' for the lead Seawolf sub.
Received from server -->   ``Work will be performed in Groton, Conn., 67 percent; QuonsetPoint, R.I., 23 percent, and Charleston, S.C., 10 percent, and isexpected to be completed in May 1995,'' the service said.
Received from server -->   The Navy declined to say what type of bid Newport News had
Received from server -->submitted in its competition with General Dynamics.   The two shipyards compete annually to build the Navy's currentclass of attack submarine, the so-called ``688,'' or Los Angeles,class. Newport News was the lead contractor on that class.
Received from server -->   The Navy expects to award its last two contracts for 688 subs infiscal 1990 and then shift production entirely to the Seawolf infiscal 1991 by awarding contracts for two subs.
Received from server -->   Now that General Dynamics has won the contract to build the leadboat, Newport News will not be in a position to compete in the
Received from server -->program until those fiscal 1991 contracts are awarded.   The Navy expects the new Seawolf to help rebuild the U.S. edge in
Received from server -->underwater warfare _ an advantage eroded over the past decadebecause of espionage scandals and Soviet efforts to build quieter
Received from server -->submarines of their own.   The SSN-21, like the 688-class sub, will be designed primarily to
Received from server -->hunt and kill Soviet submarines. It is supposed to feature greaterspeed, better sensors and longer-range weapons than the 688 class.
Received from server -->   The Seawolf ``is going to represent a major advance in speed,depth, quieting, weapons capability and supportability,'' the Navysaid Monday.

Received from server -->   Pakistan will try to mediate betweenthe Kremlin and Afghan guerrillas, who say they will not continue
Received from server -->talks while Moscow demands a role for Communists in Afghanistan'sfuture, an official said Monday.
Received from server -->   ``We will try to restart the process,'' a senior Foreign Ministryofficial said on condition of anonymity.
Received from server -->   About 3.5 million Afghan refugees live in Pakistan after a decadeof civil war, and Moslem guerrillas use border camps and towns as
Received from server -->bases and supply points. The Soviets have been withdrawing theirsoldiers from Afghanistan, and the last 50,000 are to be out by Feb.
Received from server -->15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement.   Insurgent leaders met twice in Islamabad last Friday with Yuli
Received from server -->Vorontsov, Soviet deputy foreign minister and ambassador toAfghanistan. But they told a news conference Monday there will be no
Received from server -->more talks until the Kremlin gives up its insistence that theCommunist Party be included in the next government.
Received from server -->   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, chairman of the seven-party guerrillaalliance, said further talks were ``futile and give propaganda
Received from server -->material'' to the Soviets.   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a Communist coup in April
Received from server -->1978. Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979,growing to an estimated 115,000 soldiers before the withdrawal began
Received from server -->May 15, 1988.   Most arms and support for the guerrillas come from the United
Received from server -->States and Pakistan.   The Pakistani official said the guerrilla alliance had fought theCommunists in Afghanistan ``for all these years and now is not
Received from server -->prepared to give them recognition. We will have to review the wholething with the alliance.''
Received from server -->   Vorontosov ended a four-day visit to Pakistan on Saturday, duringwhich he also met three times with Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub
Received from server -->Khan.   ``We have impressed upon Vorontsov the importance of recognizing
Received from server -->the realities of the situation and negotiate with'' the guerrillas,Yaqub Khan said.
Received from server -->   In early December, the Soviet envoy began a diplomatic missionseeking consensus on a broad-based government for Afghanistan afterthe Soviet withdrawal.
Received from server -->   After meetings in Saudi Arabia and Islamabad, the guerrillasinitially agreed to another round. They reversed the decision Monday
Received from server -->after Vorontsov said Moscow would find a way to support its clientregime unless a government including the Communists was in place by
Received from server -->Feb. 15.   Vorontsov also has met with Afghan guerrillas based in Iran,
Received from server -->Afghanistan's neighbor on the west, and former King Zahir Shah, whowas deposed in 1973 and lives in Rome. About 2 million Afghan
Received from server -->refugees are in Iran.   Guerrillas based in Pakistan say they will establish a council of
Received from server -->more than 400 members to choose a transitional government to replacethe Communist government in Kabul, which they say is sure to fall
Received from server -->when the Soviets are gone.   The Pakistani official said refugees will not be forced to return
Received from server -->to Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal is completed, but ``wehope there will be conditions for them to go home in peace.''</TEXT>

Received from server --><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ronald Reagan, the most conservative president
Received from server -->since Herbert Hoover, is leaving office after eight years with thehallmark programs of the New Deal and Great Society not onlyunscathed but thriving.
Received from server -->   He is also leaving a national debt that has almost tripled duringhis time and office. This mountain of debt will prove to be a severe
Received from server -->constraint on George Bush's room to maneuver.   Persons listening to Reagan's first inaugural address can beexcused for being perplexed by these developments.   On that January day in 1981, Reagan denounced budget deficits and
Received from server -->vowed to end them. He said government was not the solution to ourproblems but the problem itself.   ``You and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing live beyond our
Received from server -->means, but for only a limited period of time. Why, then, should wethink that collectively, as a nation, we're not bound by the same
Received from server -->limitation,'' Reagan asked his listeners. ``We must act today inorder to preserve tomorrow. And let there be no misunderstanding: Weare going to begin to act, beginning today.''
Received from server -->   Now, eight years later, he is leaving office after running up thelargest budget deficits in history and with a balanced budget still
Received from server -->a distant goal on the horizon. The final budget projects a 1990deficit of $92.5 billion and a balanced budget by 1993.
Received from server -->   Counting Monday's document, Reagan sent nine budgets to Congress,none of them with balanced spending and revenues. Each spending plan
Received from server -->projected that the budget would one day be balanced, but only in thedistant fugure, not in the budget year under consideration.
Received from server -->   For example, Reagan's first budget, sent up in February 1981,
Received from server -->forecast a balanced budget by 1984, the last year of his first term.Instead, the government suffered a deficit of $185.3 billion in
Received from server -->1984, an imbalance that was surpassed in both 1985 and 1986, a yearwhen the deficit hit a record $221 billion.
Received from server -->   In his final budget message to Congress, Reagan placed the blamefor the tide of red ink on the steep 1981-82 recession, which
Received from server -->lowered government revenues, and on Congress, which refused to goalong with his proposed spending cuts.
Received from server -->   But in the area of spending, Reagan himself decided that it wouldbe politically unwise to launch an assault against the major
Received from server -->middle-class government benefit programs.   He put Social Security, the most enduring legacy of Franklin
Received from server -->Roosevelt's New Deal and the government's biggest benefit program,off limits to budget cuts.
Received from server -->   As a result, Reagan's final budget projected Social Securitypayments to nearly 40 million Social Security beneficiaries would
Received from server -->total $241 billion in 1990, one-fifth of the total $1.15 trillionbudget and a 6 percent increase over the current year, a bigger
Received from server -->increase than Reagan awarded the Pentagon.
Received from server -->   Even after removing the effects of inflation, Social Securityspending has grown by 27 percent from 1980 to 1988.
Received from server -->   Medicare and Medicaid, the two biggest programs from LyndonJohnson's Great Society, are also doing well.
Received from server -->   Medicare, which provides health coverage for Social Securityrecipients, has nearly doubled during the Reagan years, as the cost
Received from server -->of health care and the elderly population have both grown at rapidclips.
Received from server -->   Medicaid, which provides health care for the poor, has shot up 50percent between 1980 and 1988.
Received from server -->   Reagan, struggling to contain health costs, did propose trimmingthe projected growth in both programs in 1990, but even with the
Received from server -->cuts the government's health bill will still represent itsfastest-growing sector.
Received from server -->   While Reagan did trim some poverty programs, including subsidizedhousing and low-income energy assistance, the budget document shows
Received from server -->overall spending in these areas remained relatively stable,
Received from server -->representing 1.7 percent of the country's total economy in 1980 and1.6 percent in 1988.
Received from server -->   One area that showed a huge increase, however, was the moneyspent to finance the national debt. The administration said the
Received from server -->government will spend $170.1 billion on interest payments in 1990.   That means that 15 cents out of every dollar of government
Received from server -->spending will go to pay the interest on the $2.6 trillion nationaldebt, a debt burden which has almost tripled during the Reagan years.
Received from server -->   Interest payments surged from 2 percent of the total economy in1980 to 3.2 percent in 1988. This development has crowded out

Received from server --><TEXT>   Women who drink caffeinatedbeverages may take longer to become pregnant, say scientists at theNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.
Received from server -->   ``Every epidemiologic study has limitations,'' said Dr. Allen J.Wilcox, principal investigator. ``The findings were strong among
Received from server -->women in our study, but we won't be convinced until otherepidemiologists find the same results in other groups.''
Received from server -->   The study was published in December in The Lancet, a Britishmedical journal.
Received from server -->   The study of caffeine's effects on pregnancy was made as part ofa study of early pregnancy in which women planning to become
Received from server -->pregnant were enrolled at the time they stopped using birth control.
Received from server -->   A group of 104 women provided data on the amount of caffeinatedbeverages they consumed during the time they tried to conceive, the
Received from server -->study said. Women who drank more than one cup of caffeinated coffeea day, or the equivalent in tea and colas, took significantly longer
Received from server -->to become pregnant than women who drank less.   The husbands' caffeine consumption has no apparent effect, the
Received from server -->study said. Factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, frequencyof intercourse and women's age did not change the findings.
Received from server -->   ``Even if the effect is real, there is no evidence that caffeinedoes permanent harm,'' Wilcox said. ``Our data suggests that it is
Received from server -->the women's current caffeine consumption, not her past habits, thataffects her fertility.
Received from server -->   ``Fortunately, women can avoid caffeinated beverages if
Received from server -->necessary. Also, there were women in our study who became pregnant
Received from server -->quickly even while drinking large amounts of coffee. Obviously, ifcaffeine is an influence on fertility, it is not the only influence.Some women may be more susceptible to caffeine effects than others.''</TEXT></DOC><DOC><DOCNO> AP890109-0206 </DOCNO>

Received from server --><TEXT>   The announcement Monday that Prince Philip will
Received from server -->represent his wife, Queen Elizabeth II, at the funeral of EmperorHirohito of Japan brought angry protests from lawmakers and WorldWar II veterans.
Received from server -->   Buckingham Palace announced that Philip, who served in the Far
Received from server -->East during the war and was present at the Japanese surrender in
Received from server -->Tokyo Bay, would attend the Feb. 24 services in Tokyo for Hirohito,who died Jan. 7 at the age of 87 after 62 years on the throne.
Received from server -->   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe will represent Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher's government.   Conservative lawmaker Terry Dicks urged the prince to resign as
Received from server -->president of the Burma Star Association, the organization of FarEast war veterans, some of whom urged the royal family to boycott
Received from server -->the services. Dicks said whoever made the decision to send him``should be shot.''
Received from server -->   The queen, who does not attend the funerals of heads of state,acts on the advice of government ministers on such issues as sending
Received from server -->representatives.   Harold Payne, president of the National Federation of Far Eastern
Received from server -->Prisoners-of-War Associations, said he was ``deeply saddened'' bythe decision.   Opposition Labor Party lawmaker Ron Brown, who described Hirohito
Received from server -->as ``a war criminal of the worst kind,'' called for a nationwidecampaign to change the decision.   ``It is a grave insult to many people who were enslaved, torturedand killed by the Japanese during the last war,'' he said.
Received from server -->   But David Owen, leader of the moderate Social Democratic andLabor Party, described the choice of the Duke of Edinburgh as``imaginative, correct and courageous.''
Received from server -->   Conservative lawmaker Ivor Stanbrook also applauded the decision.``The proper time to consider relations with the emperor of Japan
Received from server -->was when we invited him here in 1971 as an honored guest on a statevisit,'' he said.
Received from server -->   Critics say the presence of a member of the British royal familywould dignify a monarch who oversaw Japan's militaristic regime
Received from server -->during World War II and its harsh treatment of prisoners.   About 27,000 British prisoners died at the hands of the Japanesein the 1939-1945 war, and many survivors regard him as a warcriminal.
Received from server -->   Historians generally agree that Hirohito was a figurehead wholacked power to do anything but approve decisions of military
Received from server -->leaders.   Hirohito visted Britain in 1971, and the queen made an officialreturn visit in 1975.
Received from server -->   A 1986 visit to Japan by Prince Charles and his wife, PrincessDiana, played a significant role in smoothing postwar relations

Received from server -->   The anti-American rhetoric ebbed Monday asdiplomats worked to fashion a Security Council resolution criticalof the U.S. downing of two Libyan MiGs but mild enough to survive
Received from server -->U.S. and British veto threats.   Britain agrees with Washington's explanation that the LibyanMiG-23s acted in a threatening manner on Wednesday in flying toward
Received from server -->two U.S. F-14s on patrol over international waters in theMediterranean.   The U.N. Charter permits use of force in self-defense.
Received from server -->   Libya says the MiGs were on reconnaissance and unarmed. In
Received from server -->Security Council debate Friday, U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Waltersshowed photographs of one MiG with what he said were missiles underits wings. Libyam envoy Ali Sunni Muntasser said the pictures wereretouched.   Diplomats said on condition of anonymity that they expect America
Received from server -->and Britain will jointly veto any resolution critical of the United
Received from server -->States. The council reconvenes Tuesday afternoon and a vote isexpected later in the day.   The diplomats said the non-aligned nations were tinkering with
Received from server -->the language of a critical resolution, dropping ``condemn'' andsubstituting ``strongly deplore,'' and referring to a U.S.
Received from server -->``attack'' and not an ``unprovoked attack.''   Council speeches Monday were more temperate than Friday's heated
Received from server -->exchanges between Libya and the United States and some of the otherspeeches.   The speakers on Monday _ Finland, Ethiopia, Senegal, Sudan,
Received from server -->India, Morocco, Bangladesh and France _ contrasted the air fight
Received from server -->over the Mediterranean in the first week of the new year with theatmosphere of detente and cooperation that prevailed in 1988.   The aerial battle and the war of words between Libya and America``were like thunder in a calm sky,'' said Senegal's Saidou Nourou Ba.
Received from server -->   ``We hope every one will exercise restraint and refrain from anyact which could enhance tensions,'' said French envoy Pierre
Received from server -->Brochand.   A draft resolution circulated by the non-aligned nations asks the
Received from server -->U.S. Navy to withdraw from international waters in the Mediterranean.   Libyan Ambassador Ali A. Treiki told reporters later thenon-aligned nations were still discussing changes in the draft.
Received from server -->   ``The tone was quite different today in the chamber,'' Walters
Received from server -->said afterward. ``Today there was considerably more temperatelanguage.''
Received from server -->   But he said the latest compromise resolution still was ``notsufficiently good for me to change my position on it'' _ meaningveto it.   Each of the five permanent council members _ the United States,
Received from server -->the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France _ has veto power to killany resolution.   British Ambassador Sir Crispin Tickell told reporters, ``The
Received from server -->United States acted within its rights ... (of) self-defense, soalthough we, like everybody else, regret the incident, we're not in
Received from server -->the business of condemning or deploring actions by the United Statesin this regard.''   Commenting on the more moderate speeches Monday, Tickell said
Received from server -->that ``perhaps, even in some quarters, good sense gradually creepsin like a tide.''
Received from server -->   China and the Soviet Union were expected to vote in favor of anyresolution. France was likely to abstain.
Received from server -->   The 10 non-permanent council members are Canada, Finland,Ethiopia, Colombia, Malaysia, Algeria, Brazil, Nepal, Senegal and

Received from server -->   The horrible deaths by poison gas of nearly 1
Received from server -->million soldiers in the trenches of World War I so shocked the worldthat in 1925 a group of nations agreed never to use such weaponsagain.
Received from server -->   But this week's Paris conference reviewing the agreement takesplace with a clock grimly ticking. Each year, observers say, the
Received from server -->list of countries owning and developing chemical weapons grows. Andthe use of such weapons lies in the not-so-distant past.
Received from server -->   Under strong international public pressure, the 1925 GenevaProtocol was reached banning the use of chemical weapons, and 118
Received from server -->countries signed up. Sixty-four years later, delegates at the
Received from server -->conference are reviewing the violations of the ban over the yearsand discussing ways to give it meaning and teeth.   The 1925 protocol covers only use. Most delegates here agree theworld also needs to ban development, production and storage of toxicagents. They also agree some organization, maybe the United Nations,
Received from server -->should be able to check that countries are abiding by the ban andthat those violating it should be punished.
Received from server -->   The need for an expanded international agreement on chemical and
Received from server -->biological arms has been recognized for a long time. Negotiators
Received from server -->have been meeting periodically to come up with an accord for 17years.
Received from server -->   When the last meeting in Geneva of the ad hoc committee onchemical weapons under the U.N. Conference on Disarmament closedApril 28 last year, nothing was ready to sign. Optimists said a
Received from server -->convention might be ready in another couple of years.
Received from server -->   President Reagan, speaking to the U.N. General Assembly lastfall, called for the international conference. President FrancoisMitterrand, speaking a few days later, agreed to host it.
Received from server -->   The 150 countries meeting in Paris hope they can find enough
Received from server -->common ground by Wednesday's close of their five-day meeting toissue a final document sending a clear political message to thenegotiators: The world wants a new accord.
Received from server -->   The United States and the Soviet Union admit to having thousands
Received from server -->of tons in storage, but experts say at least 20 other countrieseither have poison arms or will before long.
Received from server -->   Countries that have chemical weapons sell them to others thatdon't, some experts at the meeting say. And possible customers
Received from server -->include terrorist groups.
Received from server -->   ``Who wants chemical weapons?'' asked a U.S. expert, speaking on
Received from server -->condition he not be named. ``I can't give you a list but I can giveyou a set of criteria:
Received from server -->   ``Anybody who's got a neighbor who has them. Anybody who has aresistence they want wiped out. Anybody with no chance of havingnuclear weapons. There are 40 or 50 countries that meet that
Received from server -->criteria,'' he said.   Western officials say interest in developing toxic arms is keen
Received from server -->in the Middle East. They say Iraq has used chemical weapons over thelast five years and has more experience with toxic agents and
Received from server -->developing ``delivery systems,'' than either the Soviet Union or theUnited States.   Condemned by U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, the
Received from server -->Iraqi use of deadly poison is only the most recent example ofrepeated violations.   Others accused of breaking the agreement include Italy inEthiopia, Japan in China, Egypt in North Yemen, the United States in
Received from server -->Vietnam, the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, Libya in Chad and, if Nazigas chambers are included, Germany in the death camps of World War
Received from server -->II.   Intelligence sources say other countries having chemical weapons

Received from server --><TEXT>   Marine Commandant Gen. Al Gray on Mondayaccepted an investigative report which concludes there was a ``total
Received from server -->breakdown'' in accountability procedures within a unit that left ayoung enlisted man to die in the California desert during a trainingexercise.
Received from server -->   The Marine Corps, in a statement released at its Washingtonheadquarters, said Gray ordered a review of the conduct of some
Received from server -->additional officers in the affected unit after reviewing the report.   One officer is already facing a preliminary investigation in the
Received from server -->matter and two sergeants are facing special courts-martial later
Received from server -->this month at Camp Lejeune, N.C.   Those three have either been charged or are facing charges ofdereliction of duty in the death of Lance Cpl. Jason J. Rother, 19,
Received from server -->of Minneapolis, Minn. Rother's platoon leader and company commanderalso have been relieved of their duties and reprimanded.
Received from server -->   ``Based upon additional recommendations made by the investigatingofficer ... the commanding general of the 2nd Marine Division has
Received from server -->been directed to review the report and take appropriate action with
Received from server -->respect to the battalion commander and the battalion executiveofficer of Rother's unit _ the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment ofthe 2nd Marine Division,'' the headquarters statement said Monday.
Received from server -->   ``Gen. Gray stated that he would not accept `wasting lives inso-called training accidents,''' the statement said.   Quoting Gray, the statement continued: ``Rother's death was not
Received from server -->an accident. Accidents happen. His death didn't just happen; ratherit was the culminating event in a series of acts, each consciously
Received from server -->committed by human beings ... It was the certain and foreseeableresult of an attitude which I intend to see erased from our corps.''
Received from server -->   Rother was assigned to serve as a road guide during an exerciseat the Marine base at Twentynine Palms, Calif., last August, and was
Received from server -->not picked up after his unit moved through the area.   Despite an extensive search, his remains were not discovered
Received from server -->until Dec. 4. Moreover, the Marine was not reported missing foralmost 40 hours after he should have been picked up.
Received from server -->   The investigation accepted by Gray ``concluded that poor planningand direction in the placement and recovery of the Marines assigned

Received from server -->within Rother's unit led to the delay in accounting for hiswhereabouts,'' the corps said Monday.   The actions of some individuals in the unit reflect ``a state of

Received from server -->   State pro-choice advocates said they wereconcerned about the U.S. Supreme Court's decision Monday to review aMissouri law regulating abortions, but also said it might fire uptheir movement.   ``We are hopeful that the Supreme Court will realize the
Received from server -->importance of having the option of abortion,'' said B.J.
Received from server -->Isaacson-Jones, executive director of Reproductive Health Services,
Received from server -->an abortion clinic named in the state's appeal to the Supreme Court.   She said she also saw the decision as ``an opportunity for
Received from server -->pro-choice people to keep the issue of choice in front of America.''   Leaders from the movement to halt abortions were elated by thejustices' decision to study a lower-court ruling that struck down
Received from server -->key provisions of the Missouri law.   Justice Department lawyers want the high court to use the
Received from server -->Missouri case as a means of undoing its landmark 1973 Roe vs. Waderuling, which legalized abortion.
Received from server -->   There was nothing in Monday's brief order that indicated theSupreme Court would reconsider its ruling of 16 years ago.
Received from server -->   ``We hoped all along that we could get the case up to the Supreme
Received from server -->Court and have the court look at some very important issues,'' saidSam Lee, legislative director for Missouri Citizens For Life. ``Andwe think with some changes in the court in the past couple years
Received from server -->there's a good chance that Roe vs. Wade may be partially or even
Received from server -->completely overturned.''   Erika Fox, director of public affairs for Planned Parenthood ofGreater Kansas City, said the decision would provide a chance toemphasize ``the dire consequences on the life and health of women
Received from server -->and their families if the clock is turned back to the time American
Received from server -->women were mutilated and even died as a result of botchedabortions.''   Isaacsn-Jones added, ``People assumed that reproductive freedomis protected by the Constitution. We know that may not be the case.
Received from server -->It is time for us to reorganize, regroup, be more vocal, be more
Received from server -->visible.''.   In July, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is based in
Received from server -->St. Louis, struck down several provisions of Missouri's abortionlaw, including:
Received from server -->   _a ban on using public hospitals or other government-runfacilities for abortions not necessary to save a woman's life;
Received from server -->   _a ban prohibiting any public employee from performing orassisting an abortion;
Received from server -->   _and a ban on using taxpayer money for ``encouraging orcounseling'' women to have abortions.   In the state's appeal, Attorney General William Webster said the8th Circuit Court's ruling ``expands (Supreme Court) precedents in
Received from server -->favor of abortion on demand.''   State Rep. Jim Barnes, a sponsor of the original law, said he was
Received from server -->pleased with the court's decision. But he said he did not believe it
Received from server -->would serve to overturn the decision in Roe vs. Wade.   He predicted that if the Supreme Court ruled in favor of thestate, other states would use the law as a pattern for restricting

Received from server --><TEXT>   President Reagan asked Congress on Monday to
Received from server -->increase spending on fighting drugs by 14 percent in a budgetproposal that the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration said
Received from server -->``clearly gives the message that drug law enforcement remains apriority.''
Received from server -->   In his proposed budget for fiscal 1990, Reagan asked for $5.034billion for the law enforcement, prevention and treatment agencies
Received from server -->engaged in the war on drugs. That reflects a $633 million increaseover the $4.401 billion to be spent this fiscal year.
Received from server -->   Asked if the increase is enough to tell the American people that
Received from server -->the administration is serious about a war on drugs, Deputy AttorneyGeneral Harold G. Christensen told reporters, ``I think that this
Received from server -->program, given the constraints, does address that problem.''   John C. Lawn, administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Received from server -->Administration, said that while the total increase for the Justice
Received from server -->Department in the proposed budget is 7 percent, ``the increase forthe Drug Enforcement Administration, in real money, is 13 percent.''
Received from server -->   ``I think this clearly gives the message that drug lawenforcement remains a priority of this government and this
Received from server -->administration,'' Lawn said.
Received from server -->   The DEA would add 275 foreign and domestic positions and would beexpected to increase arrests by more than 1,100 in the 1990 fiscalyear beginning next Oct. 1, according to budget documents.   FBI Director William S. Sessions said his agency's strategy ``isaligned purely to go after major drug trafficking and moneylaundering organizations and heroin and cocaine.
Received from server -->   ``So with us, every incremental increase means that we can attackthat many more organizations,'' he said, referring to a proposed $12million boost in FBI spending on drugs next year.
Received from server -->   When the FBI received $15 million more as a result of the 1986
Received from server -->drug bill, Sessions said the agency was able to mount attacks on anaddtional 5 percent to 10 percent of the approximately 450 majordrug trafficking organizations.
Received from server -->   Reagan requested a total of $3.49 billion in fiscal 1990 for law
Received from server -->enforcement in the drug wars, including $3.5 million in outlays forthe office of the new drug czar.   Once appointed, whoever holds that position will also be in
Received from server -->control of up to $136 million in forfeitures of property seized indrug-related cases.
Received from server -->   The budget requests also seeks $915.3 million in fiscal 1990expenditures on drug abuse prevention and $633.2 million for
Received from server -->treatment programs, according to an administration official.   Within the law enforcement category, drug interdiction efforts
Received from server -->would receive the largest allocation _ $1.22 billion.   Spending on corrections facilities to house drug offenders would
Received from server -->total $722.3 million. Investigations would receive $716.4 million;prosecutions, $306.7 million, and international programs, $238.3
Received from server -->million.
Received from server -->   Reagan is seekikng $415 million for the U.S. Customs Service to``greatly expand the number of intensive examinations of high-risk
Received from server -->containerized cargo shipments,'' the budget documents said.   The Coast Guard, meanwhile, would get an additional $47 million
Received from server -->to finance two surveillance aircraft and two land-based balloons for
Received from server -->spotting drug smugglers, according to the documents.
Received from server -->   The government said the addition of 940 positions proposed for
Received from server -->the U.S. attorney offices nationwide is expected to increase thenumber of drug prosecutions in 1990 by 3,600 cases. In addition,
Received from server -->money has been requested to fund 6,685 new prison and jail bed
Received from server -->spaces as well as leasing authority for 1,160 more.   Departments or agencies to receive significant amounts of money
Received from server -->for combatting drugs are:   The Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration, $897.5

Received from server --><TEXT>   President Reagan on Monday proposed increasing
Received from server -->by half a billion dollars the down payment on modernizing andcleaning up the nation's atomic weapons complex _ a job expected to
Received from server -->cost $81 billion over the next 20 years.   In his fiscal 1990 budget for the Energy Department, which makes
Received from server -->the nuclear warheads for the Pentagon, Reagan asked for $3.014billion for modernization, environmental and safety programs at the
Received from server -->weapons plants. That is $478 million more than is being spent thisyear.
Received from server -->   The proposal drew immediate criticism from Sen. John Glenn,
Received from server -->D-Ohio, who charged the Reagan budget was not enough to preventfurther environmental contamination, let alone clean up the mess
Received from server -->produced over the past 45 years.   ``It's just a token of what is needed for cleanup,'' said Glenn,who said it will take at least $1.8 billion a year ``to even just
Received from server -->get started.'' He urged President-elect Bush to do more.   Deputy Energy Secretary Joseph F. Salgado told reporters the
Received from server -->department was ``dealing resolutely with our safety andenvironmental problems'' and has established a process ``to addressthis problem in the long term.''
Received from server -->   The department said it plans to seek a total of $18 billion overthe next five years to build new facilities and improve the existing
Received from server -->weapons complex of 17 major factories and laboratories in 12 states.   According to budget documents, 60 percent of the Energy
Received from server -->Department's total $15 billion in requested spending authority isdevoted to research and production of nuclear weapons and DefenseDepartment projects.
Received from server -->   Energy officials were unable to provide a comprehensive detailedbreakdown of requested outlays _ money that would actually be spent
Received from server -->in the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1.   Those outlays usually run below the requested spending authority,which includes planned expenditure obligations on multiyear projects.
Received from server -->   The department is requesting spending authority of $303.5 millionfor designing two new nuclear reactors to replace three 35-year-old
Received from server -->reactors at its Savannah River Plant, in Aiken, S.C., which havebeen shut down since last April for safety reasons.   It is not clear when the department will restart the first of the
Received from server -->Savannah River reactors, which produce tritium, a fast-decaying
Received from server -->isotope of hydrogen that is needed for modern thermonuclear weapons.
Received from server -->   But as a replacement for the old reactors, the department isproposing to build a new heavy water facility at Savannah River at
Received from server -->an estimated cost of $3.2 billion and a new gas-cooled reactor at
Received from server -->Idaho Falls, Idaho, costing $3.6 billion. Both would becomeoperational about the turn of the century.
Received from server -->   To clean up individual sites in the complex, the department is
Received from server -->requesting an increase in spending authority from $19 million this
Received from server -->year to $56 million in 1990 for Savannah River, from $50 million to$55 million for the Feed Materials Production Center in Fernald,
Received from server -->Ohio, and from $28 million to $54 million for the Hanford site atRichland, Wash.
Received from server -->   ``There has been no decision'' on shutting down Fernald oranother plant, Rocky Flats near Denver, Salgado told reporters.
Received from server -->Administration sources have said that the two might close at anunspecified future date because they are near cities and would beexpensive to modernize.   Energy Secretary John S. Herrington had asked the White House for
Received from server -->an additional $360 million to be spent by Sept. 30 of this year to
Received from server -->clean up the nuclear weapons complex, but the request was turned
Received from server -->down.   Instead, White House Chief of Staff Kenneth N. Duberstein
Received from server -->authorized the department to allocate $150 million in unspent funds
Received from server -->for the cleanup effort.
Received from server -->   In documents sent to Congress last July, the department estimated
Received from server -->that the cleanup effort could cost up to $110 billion over the next
Received from server -->40 years.
Received from server -->   A more detailed classified study, the 2010 Report, estimated that
Received from server -->the costs will reach $81 billion over the next two decades,according to administration and congressional sources familiar withthe document.   That report envisaged a substantial increase in funding over
Received from server -->1989-90 levels, starting sometime in the 1990s.   Of the total cleanup costs of $110 billion, nearly half or $46
Received from server -->billion would be spent at Hanford, which began operating as a top
Received from server -->secret facility in 1944 producing fuel for the first U.S. atomicweapons, according to the report sent to Congress.</TEXT></DOC><DOC><DOCNO> AP890109-0215 </DOCNO><FILEID>AP-NR-01-09-89 1757EST</FILEID>

Received from server -->leave by April 1 under a peace agreement for southern Africa.   They thrust flowers into the hands of officers and soldiers as
Received from server -->Defense Minister Pedro Maria Tonha told the men assembled at the
Received from server -->training camp: ``Don't ever forget Angola, because you fought anddied here.''
Received from server -->   The first 450 Cubans are to depart Tuesday, in a symbolicairlift, under terms of the agreement mediated by the United States
Received from server -->and signed Dec. 22 by Angola, Cuba and South Africa. The rest of the3,000 troops are expected to return to Cuba by ship.
Received from server -->   Angola and Cuba have asked the United Nations to pay theestimated $800 million cost of sending the estimated 50,000 Cubanshome from Angola.
Received from server -->   Their repatriation is part of a plan intended to bring peace tosouthern Africa and independence to South-West Africa, also known as
Received from server -->Namibia, after U.N.-sponsored elections.
Received from server -->   Not included in the agreement are rebels fighting Angola's
Received from server -->Marxist government with U.S. and South African support, and theSouth-West Africa People's Organization, a guerrilla group opposingSouth African control of Namibia.   Tonha decorated 13 ranking Cuban officers, including Gen. RaulMenedez Tomassevic. Among those attending the ceremony were Gen.
Received from server -->Abelardo Colome Ibarra, vice minister of the Cuban armed forces, andGen. Pericles Ferreira Gomes of Brazil, head of the U.N. observers
Received from server -->who will monitor the withdrawal over 27 months.   Cuban officials at the Funda camp 22 miles northeast of Luanda,
Received from server -->the capital, said the ceremony brought together the largest numberof Cuban officers ever assembled outside the Carribean island nation.
Received from server -->   Soldiers from Cuba arrived in July 1975, to support thegovernment that won control after independence from Portugal in itsbattle with rebels of the National Union for the Total Independenceof Angola.   The United States has said it will continue military assistanceto UNITA until the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
Received from server -->agrees to negotiate with the rebels.   Brig. Gen. Rafael Moracen Limonta, who first came to Angola in1965 as an adviser to Marxist guerrillas fighting the Portuguese,said the departure was possible because South Africa agreed to
Received from server -->withdraw from southern Angola, where its forces pursued SWAPOguerrillas, and allow independence in Namibia.   ``The problem with UNITA is among the Angolans themselves,'' he
Received from server -->said, standing with other officers on the parade ground. ``We came
Received from server -->here because of the South Africans.''   Angola and South Africa agreed to a cease-fire in southern Angola
Received from server -->on Aug. 8, and South African troops withdrew into Namibia.   South Africa captured Namibia from Germany in World War I and
Received from server -->controlled it under a League of Nations mandate. The U.N. GeneralAssembly ended the mandate in 1966, but South Africa had refused toleave.
Received from server -->   All but a token South African force is to withdraw from theterritory by Nov. 1, when Namibia is to hold its first free
Received from server -->legislative elections.   Some questions remain about how 70 military and 20 civilian U.N.
Received from server -->observers will monitor the departure of Cuban troops from a country14 times the size of Portugal.   Gen. Ferreira Gomes said he would rely on the ``good word'' of
Received from server -->the Cubans and Angolans, but another military observer saidprivately his mission is ``to count heads.''

Received from server -->   Officials cleared a second companyalleged to have helped Libya build a chemical weapons plant, and a
Received from server -->ranking lawmaker said such accusations have totally discredited WestGerman businesses.
Received from server -->   A Finance Ministry spokesman in Bonn, the capital, said a probeof the Hamburg-based Pen Tsao medical material company turned up
Received from server -->``no evidence they are connected in the Libyan affair.''
Received from server -->   Spokesman Walter Prax said the subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based
Received from server -->Pen Tsao was investigated by Hamburg-state officials from Jan. 3through Jan. 7.
Received from server -->   Prax said in a telephone interview that the Finance Ministryordered the probe after Washington alleged that West Germancompanies were helping Libya build a chemical weapons plant inRabta, 60 miles south of Tripoli. Libya says the plant produces
Received from server -->pharmaceuticals.   West German officials in the southern state of Baden-Wuerttemberglast week announced no evidence was found connecting theImhausen-Chemie company in the Black Forest city of Lahr of being
Received from server -->involved with the Libyan plant.
Received from server -->   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz expressed his trust ofWest Germany's handling of the probe to West German Foreign MinisterHans-Dietrich Genscher in Paris over the weekend.
Received from server -->   But Hans Stercken, a federal lawmaker and member of Chancellor
Received from server -->Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Party, said in a radio interviewthat he was not satisfied.   ``I say in all openness that it (Shultz's comments) doesn'tsuffice for me'' Stercken said in an interview with the
Received from server -->Cologne-based Deutschlandfunk radio. ``This doesn't concern the goodintentions of the Federal Republic, which no one has seriously

Received from server -->(West Germany) have been totally discredited,'' said the lawmaker,
Received from server -->who heads Parliament's foreign affairs committee.
Received from server -->   He said the United States has not supplied details about the
Received from server -->American suspicions as requested. West German and U.S. officialswere expected to meet this week to review the allegations.
Received from server -->   Stercken also said the issue should not have come to a head
Received from server -->through the American media and that the United States and WestGermany should have had more communication about the U.S.allegations.
Received from server -->   ``One cannot deal with each other in this manner,'' he said.   U.S. media reported last week that in addition to West Germancompanies, Italian and Japanese firms were supplying Libya withmaterial and know-how to build the plant.

Received from server -->   The Reagan administration unveiled a $13.2billion foreign assistance budget for fiscal 1990 Monday, about a
Received from server -->third of which was to cover economic and military aid to Israel andEgypt.   Briefing reporters on the overall request, Deputy Secretary of
Received from server -->State John Whitehead said the budget would provide for the firsttime since 1986 full funding of U.S. asssessed contributions to theUnited Nations and other international organizations.
Received from server -->   Overall, the administration requested $14.8 billion in spendingauthority but planned to spend $13.2 billion of that during the
Received from server -->coming year.   The recommendations are subject to change because neither the
Received from server -->incoming Bush administration nor the Democratic-controlled Congressis bound by them.   The proposal was identical in most respects to the 1989 budget
Received from server -->although the administration decided to proposal the disbursal of allmilitary aid on a grant basis. Historically, a portion of militaryassistance has been in the form of credits.   Among the new items in the budget were $50 million in spendingauthority for the U.N. forces that will oversee the transition thisyear of Namibian independence from South African rule and $20

Received from server --><TEXT>   In a valedictory speech, Secretary of State
Received from server -->George P. Shultz on Monday night condemned leaks and lies ingovernment and ``the old American inclination to withdraw from the
Received from server -->world.''
Received from server -->   Apart from the criticism, Shultz said he was leaving his post
Received from server -->after more than six years convinced that ``ours is a winning hand.''   Shultz said the United States was approaching a new era in
Received from server -->international affairs in a world that had undergone significantchanges:
Received from server -->   _ Fear of nuclear war was greatly diminished.
Received from server -->   _ A new U.S.-Soviet relationship promised to reduce tensions andto increase cooperation in solving world problems.   _ A new global economy based on information and openness wasreplacing old divisions based on national borders and ancient
Received from server -->rivalries.   _ Human rights, the rule of law and the practice of democracy
Received from server -->were taking root and spreading.
Received from server -->   Shultz, who first came to Washington more than 30 years ago, said
Received from server -->he would go home to California next week convinced that America ``islighting the way for the hopes and aspirations of countless millionsaround the world.''
Received from server -->   His remarks were prepared for delivery at a reception given forhim at the State Department by the Citizens Network for Foreign
Received from server -->Affairs, a private group.   While most of Shultz's speech was positive, he said ``some thingsare worse,'' including a steady erosion in the precepts of public
Received from server -->service.
Received from server -->   Shultz criticized ``declinists,'' or those who ``play to the idea
Received from server -->that America no longer has anything to give the world.''   Without specifying any particular individual or group, Shultzsaid ``they touch on the old American inclination to withdraw fromthe world in order to regain economic or moral security.''
Received from server -->   Shultz said their ideas should be rejected.   Also, he criticized ``a dangerous loss of trust'' within the
Received from server -->government. Specifically, Shultz scored infighters in the executivebranch who use ``leaks and lies'' to influence decisions.   ``Our decisions should be fairly made, and once they are, they
Received from server -->should be carried out, like it or not,'' Shultz said.
Received from server -->   ``You live up to your oath of office not just by carrying out
Received from server -->decisions you agree with, but by carrying out decisions you don'tagree wtih _ or else resigning.''   Again, Shultz gave no examples.   During his stay at the State Department he offered to resignthree times _ over proposed lie-detector tests; a mission he was not
Received from server -->aware of to the Middle East by Robert C. McFarlane, then the WhiteHouse national security adviser, and his inability to secure a plane
Received from server -->for an overseas assignment.   On the other hand, Shultz privately opposed the decision by
Received from server -->President Reagan to approve secret U.S. arms sales to Iran but did

Received from server --><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Justice Department announced Monday it will
Received from server -->sue to block two proposed joint ventures between Westinghouse
Received from server -->Electric Corp. and a Swiss company.   The ventures between Westinghouse and Asea Brown Boveri Inc. ofZurich would involve the manufacture and sale of electric power
Received from server -->generation, transmission and distribution products.   ``The proposed joint ventures pose significant threats tocompetition in equipment and services necessary for this country's
Received from server -->production of electric power,'' said Charles F. Rule, assistantattorney general in charge of the antitrust division.
Received from server -->   As a result, ``the reduction of competition in these markets
Received from server -->would likely mean higher electric rates for all users of electricity
Received from server -->and higher prices for many products manufactured using
Received from server -->electricity,'' Rule said.
Received from server -->   If the anti-competitive aspects can be resolved through arestructuring of the joint ventures, the antitrust division still
Received from server -->would file a civil lawsuit, but it would be accompanied by a consent
Received from server -->decree incorporating the changes which settle the suit, Rule said.   Westinghouse spokesman Jim Schmitt said that ``the negotiationsare continuing that may enable the transactions to go forward.''
Received from server -->   Under the joint ventures announced by Westinghouse in April 1988,
Received from server -->Westinghouse would hold 55 percent and ABB 45 percent in each
Received from server -->partnership, Schmitt said.   ``In both cases, each partner will contribute the manufacturing
Received from server -->plants and engineering and marketing organizations of its involvedoperations,'' he said. ``In addition, Westinghouse will receive
Received from server -->about $500 million from ABB for the two partnership interests.''   A Justice Department statement said competitive concerns caused
Received from server -->by one of the ventures focus on power transformers used by electric
Received from server -->utilities to convert electricity to different voltages so that itcan be transmitted efficiently over long distances. The combined
Received from server -->power transformer sales of Westinghouse and ABB would exceed 50percent of total U.S. sales, which were more than $400 million in
Received from server -->1988, the department said.   The concern with the second venture focused on the manufacture
Received from server -->and sale of steam turbine generators and the sale of major repairservices on existing turbine generating equipment, Rule said.
Received from server -->   Westinghouse, ABB, and General Electric of Fairfield, Conn., arethe three leading U.S. suppliers of medium and large steam turbine
Received from server -->generators.   Westinghouse and ABB are two of only four significant sellers ofmajor turbine generator repair and related services to U.S.
Received from server -->utilities, along with GE and Utility Power Corp., a subsidiary ofSiemens A.G. of West Germany, Rule said. U.S. sales of steam turbinegenerators and the pertinent services are estimated at over $600

Received from server -->   Outside the imperial palace, nearly 315,000 mourners signed
Received from server -->registers of condolence Monday for Emperor Hirohito, who died ofcancer Saturday at age 87. His 62-year reign was marked by the riseof militarism, defeat in the war and Japan's emergence as a leadingeconomic power.
Received from server -->   One mourner outside, 36-year-old pianist Yumiko Ideta, said ofthe new imperial era: ``I and many of my generation think it will bea good chance for Akihito to do the things his father wasn't able to

Received from server -->   Akihito, 55, is expected to be closer to the people than hisfather, who was considered a living god until he renounced theconcept of imperial divinity after World War II.   On Monday, in his first speech as emperor, Akihito said he would
Received from server -->continue on Hirohito's path, ``making his desire to constantly be at

Received from server -->preserve the constitution of Japan.''   He reaffirmed the limits placed on his role by the constitution,which makes him ``a symbol of the state and the unity of thepeople.'' His duties are ceremonial, consisting of signing bills
Received from server -->into law and meeting foreign dignitaries.   By emphasizing the constitution drawn up in the U.S. occupation
Received from server -->of 1945-52, Akihito was expected to win praise from liberals. Theyhave criticized recent attempts by rightist members of the rulingLiberal Democratic Party to revise the document and declare theemperor ``head'' of the nation.

Received from server -->son, Crown Prince Naruhito.   Eizo Kobayashi, a senior Communist Party official, told reporters
Received from server -->later: ``No matter what the new emperor says, we must realize thepossible danger of his role. Our task now is to oppose reactionary,
Received from server -->political use of the emperor and to promote the peaceful clauses ofthe postwar constitution.''
Received from server -->   Opposition political parties also say government sponsorship ofsome of the numerous rites honoring Hirohito, with their Shinto
Received from server -->practices, violates the constitution.
Received from server -->   Hirohito will be buried Feb. 24 in an imperial mausoleum inHachioji, a western suburb, after a state funeral in the ShinjukuGyoen Imperial Gardens and a public procession.
Received from server -->   In one of about 60 funeral and transition rites, Emperor Akihitopaid final respects to his father Monday and palace officials sealedHirohito's body, in a coffin of Japanese cypress, inside a coppercontainer, news reports said.
Received from server -->   Officials said slightly more than 1 million mourners had visitedthe palace in central Tokyo since Saturday to sign the condolencebooks, and about 350,000 had signed 11 other registers around thecountry.   Two old soldiers hanged themselves Saturday and Sunday, leaving
Received from server -->suicide notes saying they wanted to follow the emperor in death.   Teinosuke Watanabe, an 82-year-old retired company president,said after signing the palace condolence register Monday: ``For my
Received from server -->generation, the emperor was an honorable man. In his own way he hasadmitted responsibility for the war ... traveling around the countryto meet the people as they rebuilt.   ``By living, he has borne the heavy burden of war
Received from server -->responsibility.''
Received from server -->   How much responsibility Hirohito bore has been a matter of
Received from server -->controversy, but historians generally agree he was a figurehead withtoo little power to do anything but approve decisions of military
Received from server -->leaders.</TEXT>

Received from server --><TEXT>   The Reagan administration on Monday proposed toboost spending for AIDS research and prevention by 13 percent but toreduce the growth of the Medicare and Medicaid health programs by
Received from server -->cutting payments to states, hospitals and physicians.
Received from server -->   Overall, the budget of the Department of Health and Human
Received from server -->Services _ the largest federal department _ would increase 5.7
Received from server -->percent to $424.4 billion in fiscal 1990. HHS spending accounts forabout 37 percent of the federal budget.   Medicare and Medicaid have been fueling the growth of thedepartment's budget. Medicare has been growing faster than thenumber of beneficiaries and far more rapidly than inflation, even
Received from server -->inflation in medical prices. Between 1980 and 1989, Medicare has
Received from server -->grown about 12 percent annually, while Medicaid is growing at 13percent a year.   President Reagan said his proposed cutbacks would not reducebenefits to the 56 million elderly, disabled and low-income people
Received from server -->in the two programs, but would force the states, which administerMedicaid, and providers paid by Medicare to become more efficient
Received from server -->and reduce waste.   Reagan's critics, however, say the Medicaid cutbacks, which willreduce grants to states by 3 percent, will curtail medical servicesfor the poor.   ``Unless states have or are willing to come up with more money,
Received from server -->which many aren't, their only options are to restrict eligibility,reduce medical services or reduce fees paid to doctors,'' saidRobert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy
Received from server -->Priorities, a nonprofit group that researches policy issuesaffecting the low-income.   ``In substantial part, it will be passed along in benefit
Received from server -->reductions,'' he said.   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House health
Received from server -->subcommittee, said the Medicaid cutbacks ``put the states in afinancially untenable situation'' that will result in less coverageto low-income families.
Received from server -->   Reagan said the fight against the spread of acquired immune
Received from server -->deficiency syndrome continues to be the nation's top public health
Received from server -->priority. An estimated 1 million to 1.5 million people in the United
Received from server -->States are infected with the deadly virus though not all havedeveloped symptoms yet.
Received from server -->   Reagan proposed $160 million more for AIDS research, which wouldbring spending in fiscal 1990 to $1.4 billion, a 13 percent increase
Received from server -->over current outlays.
Received from server -->   HHS Secretary Otis Bowen had pushed for a 39 percent increaseover the 1989 budget authority of $1.3 billion, but the proposed
Received from server -->spending plan would increase spending authority by only 24 percentto $1.6 billion for fiscal 1990. Budget authority totals can bespent over more than one year.
Received from server -->   The department also estimated an additional $925 million would be
Received from server -->spent on treatment and income support to AIDS victims throughMedicaid, Medicare, Disability Insurance and other income andservice programs.   More than 82,000 AIDS cases have been reported in the United
Received from server -->States since 1981. By the end of 1992, the administration said,
Received from server -->reported AIDS cases in this country are expected to reach 365,000,
Received from server -->with 80,000 new cases and 65,000 AIDS deaths projected for that year
Received from server -->alone.   The budget proposal also increases basic biomedical research by6.6 percent to $8.5 million. Included is $100 million for a project
Received from server -->to map the human genome, the biological blueprint that determines
Received from server -->individual characteristics and that also can cause disease.   More than 94 percent of HHS spending is earmarked for entitlement
Received from server -->programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, over which the
Received from server -->agency has little budget control since eligibility for the programs
Received from server -->is set by Congress.   Reagan's budget protects Social Security benefits but proposes
Received from server -->changes that would require approval by Congress to reduce the rapidgrowth in Medicare and Medicaid spending.
Received from server -->   Hospitals ``have a lot of profit margin'' with which to absorbthe reductions and states ``need to examine how they are running
Received from server -->their Medicaid programs, not necessarily cut back benefits,'' saidElizabeth Cusick, director of the division of health benefits in the
Received from server -->office of the HHS secretary.   ``We want to encourage them to find ways to control costs,'' she
Received from server -->said.   Without any changes, the Medicare budget, which pays for the
Received from server -->health care of about 34 million elderly and disabled Americans,would grow by 14 percent in fiscal 1990. However, Reagan isproposing to trim that growth rate to 10 percent by cutting $3.5billion from fees paid to physicians and hospitals. The Medicarebudget would total $94.9 billion.
Received from server -->   About a third of the Medicare cut, $1 billion, would come fromcuts in payments to teaching hospitals, which receive additionalreimbursements to cover their costs of training interns andresidents.   Also, capital payments to hospitals would be cut for a savings of
Received from server -->$620 million and reduced fees to physicians for certain procedures,
Received from server -->including radiology, anesthesiology and surgery, that are considered
Received from server -->``overpriced'' would save about $350 million.   A new part of Medicare is the Catastrophic Health Insurance
Received from server -->program, which is intended to be entirely self-supporting. It isfinanced by premiums paid by Medicare recipients, which are
Received from server -->projected to total about $8.6 billion in fiscal 1990. The program is
Received from server -->projected to spend $4 billion in that year.
Received from server -->   Growth in Medicaid _ the program that rovides health care forabout 26 million low-income Americans _ would be 9 percent without
Received from server -->changes in the program next year. The administration is proposing toslice that to 5 percent growth with cuts totalling about $1.4
Received from server -->billion for a spending a total of $36 billion.   Much of the reduction would come from reducing payments to thestates, which administer the program under federal guidelines, by
Received from server -->about $1.1 billion.
Received from server -->   Benefits under the Social Security program are protected and theadministration projects a cost-of-living adjustment of 3.6 percentin January 1990.
Received from server -->   Currently, a newly retired 65-year-old can receive a maximum of$899 per month in Social Security benefits. A 3.6 percent increase
Received from server -->would put the maximum at $931 next year.

Received from server -->   The Environmental Protection Agency said Mondayit is considering charging the chemical industry a fee for the right
Received from server -->to produce chlorofluorocarbons as an attempt to spur the phasing outof such production.   Under international treaty, production of chlorofluorocarbons, or
Received from server -->CFCs, is to be curtailed to l986 levels next July and cut in half byl998. The chemical is widely blamed for depletion of the world'satmospheric ozone.
Received from server -->   In its fiscal l990 budget, announced Monday, the EPA said it
Received from server -->plans to propose charging the chemical industry ``market value forthe rights to produce CFCs and related ozone-depleting substances.''
Received from server -->   EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas told reporters the agency has yetto determine precisely what mechanism will be used to determine the
Received from server -->fee, which he said is expected to produce about $400 million inrevenue.
Received from server -->   Under various proposals under consideration, the government couldcharge a fee for a certain volume of CFCs produced or could auction
Received from server -->off production permits, officials suggested.   In either case, the federal fee structure is expected to keepproducers from reaping windfall profits as the available volume ofCFCs is reduced in the coming years. Federal officials fear highprofits would work against the industry rapidly developingsubstitute products.
Received from server -->   Producers of CFCs immediately criticized the plan, although it is
Received from server -->still in the preliminary stages of development.
Received from server -->   ``The government proposal is a blatant, illegal tax on an
Received from server -->industry that is striving to restructure through an orderly
Received from server -->transition to alternative products,'' said a statement issued by theDuPont Company, which is the world's largest producer of CFCs.
Received from server -->   The company said either a permit fee or an auction on permits
Received from server -->``will likely result in dislocations in the supply of theseimportant chemicals.''
Received from server -->   The EPA last summer also said in a preliminary regulatoryproposal that some kind of permit and fee structure might benecessary to prevent CFC producers from taking in windfall profitsand, thereby, slowing down the phasing out of CFC production.   Because of the concern about ozone depletion, the nation's of the
Received from server -->world have agreed that the production of chlorofluorocarbons are to
Received from server -->be phased out.   CFCs are used for a variety of purposes including as a coolant inair conditioning units and refrigerators, in Halon gas fire
Received from server -->extinguishers, in the production of styrofome, and in many countriesas a propellant in spray cans.   DuPont said that annually $28 billion in goods and services and$135 billion worth of equipment depend on CFCs in some way.

Received from server -->the Treasury over office expenses after reports said FinanceMinister Shimon Peres planned to have taxpayers pay for his ironing.
Received from server -->   The controversy came days after Peres pushed through a $600million economic austerity plan that raised prices for basics suchas milk and bread.
Received from server -->   An outcry arose over a report in the Haaretz newspaper that the
Received from server -->Finance Ministry planned to increase its budget by at least $350,000to fund special privileges for Peres and his aides. Almost $90,000
Received from server -->was allocated to Peres' personal services, such as ironing, cateringand photographs, the paper wrote.
Received from server -->   Finance Ministry spokesman Avi Gil said on Monday that Peres
Received from server -->``didn't see the budget proposal, was not asked about it and didn'tapprove it.''   He said when Peres found out about the draft after the Haaretz
Received from server -->publication, ``he canceled it immediately.''
Received from server -->   But Yossi Sarid, a legislator for the opposition Citizens Rights
Received from server -->Movement, said the ministry only backed away on Monday because ofthe public clamor.   The latest proposal calls for one mobile car telephone instead ofthree, and grants a senior aide a Ford Sierra instead of a Volvo,
Received from server -->said Sarid.   ``The other items, such as ironing and so on, will remain in thebudget, but the expenses for the photographer will be halved from$26,000 to $13,000,'' Sarid said, adding that items like ironing
Received from server -->were ``highly irregular.''   ``They won't make or break the state economy, but when everyone'stalking about tightening the belt and austerity, it's a matter ofprinciple,'' he said.   Sarid said the new budget allocation would total $34,000, less
Received from server -->than one-tenth of the original. Besides personal items, the initial
Received from server -->$350,000 figure was to cover services and overtime payments forPeres aides, Haaretz wrote.   Gil refused comment on Sarid's remarks.
Received from server -->   Guided by a Finance Ministry proposal, the Cabinet decided lastThursday to slash the state budget by $600 million. The cuts meantdrastic price increases on subsidized foodstuffs such as milk, bread
Received from server -->and yogurt, and additional charges for public high school tuitionand doctors' visits.   Political figures from right and left assailed the FinanceMinistry perquisites.   Rafael Eitan of the ultraright Tzomet Party said Peres was
Received from server -->setting a bad personal example and Ran Cohen of the left-wingCitizens Rights Movement demanded that Peres reduce his budget by 15percent rather than raise it.
Received from server -->   The parliamentary Finance Committee did not discuss the
Received from server -->controversy during its meeting Monday, but chairman Ariel Weinsteintold The Associated Press: ``I got the feeling it will become an
Received from server -->important issue.''   He said the committee would demand a detailed breakdown of theFinance Ministry's budget, although the law does not requireministries to submit their budgets for approval.   A Labor Party official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
Received from server -->blamed the misstep on Peres' aides and said it would weaken Pereswithin the party, whose younger generation has been challenging his
Received from server -->leadership.

Received from server -->   Officials said Monday both engines of anew Boeing 737 apparently failed, causing the plane to crash besideBritain's main north-south highway and kill 44 people.   Transport Minister Paul Channon said sabotage was not suspected
Received from server -->in the crash Sunday of the British Midland Airways jet, the second
Received from server -->air disaster in Britain in less than three weeks. Prime Minister
Received from server -->Margaret Thatcher said, however, that no possible cause could be
Received from server -->ruled out, including sabotage.   The Scandinavian airline SAS, part owner of British Midland,received a bomb threat against it and its subsidiaries eight daysago, but spokesman John Herbert said Monday in Stockholm no link
Received from server -->with the crash was suspected.   One aviation expert called the double engine failure a 10million-to-1 chance.   Leicestershire police revised the death toll downward to 44 on
Received from server -->Monday night. An earlier report of 46 fatalities resulted fromconfusion in counting bodies at several mortuaries, said a police
Received from server -->spokeswoman who by custom was not identified.   Eighty-two passengers and crew members _ all of the survivors ofthe crash _ were injured, including 43-year-old pilot Kevin Hunt,who was hailed as a hero for managing to miss crashing on the
Received from server -->village of Kegworth or the M1 highway.   The jet, en route from London to Belfast, plowed into a grassy
Received from server -->embankment on the highway Sunday night as the pilot struggled to
Received from server -->make an emergency landing at East Midlands Airport, about 100 milesnorth of London. He missed the runway by about half a mile.
Received from server -->   ``So far the evidence, although by no means conclusive, isconsistent with the right engine having stopped before impact and
Received from server -->there are also signs of fire in the left engine,'' Channon toldBBC-TV.
Received from server -->   Asked whether both engines malfunctioned, he replied: ``Thatcertainly looks probable at the moment.''
Received from server -->   The Boeing 737-400, delivered to British Midland just 12 weeksago, had flown less than 500 hours, the airline said. Boeing said
Received from server -->the plane had two CFM-56 engines, built in France by a consortium ofthe U.S.-based General Electric Co. and the French company SNECMA.
Received from server -->   SNECMA spokesman Olivier Fagard said he did not know whether bothengines failed.   ``It is extremely improbable that both engines would break down
Received from server -->in such a short interval,'' Fagard said in Paris. ``We have veryimpressive reliability statistics. There ws a fire in engine No. 1,
Received from server -->which was controlled. There was no fire in the other.''
Received from server -->   William Tench, retired head of Britain's Air Accidents
Received from server -->Investigation Board, said the odds against both engines failing on aBoeing 737 were about 10 million to 1. He suggested there had been a
Received from server -->``technical mistake such as something incorrect being done to theengines during turnaround (servicing between flights), eitherinadvertently or deliberately.''   Freddie Yetman, spokesman for the British Airline Pilots'Association, said a double-engine failure was ``astonishing.''
Received from server -->   ``You just don't train for something like this. You work on the
Received from server -->assumption that there will always be an engine working,'' he said.
Received from server -->   Mrs. Thatcher inspected the wreckage of the blue aircraftcrumpled among roadside trees, and visited survivors at Derby RoyalInfirmary.   Asked whether sabotage was suspected, she replied: ``We rule out
Received from server -->nothing _ we simply can't.''   Mrs. Thatcher said she ``almost couldn't believe it'' when she
Received from server -->heard about the crash, so soon after a bomb blew apart Pan Am Flight
Received from server -->103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on Dec. 21, killing all 259people on board and 11 on the ground.
Received from server -->   The Rev. Ian Paisley, the hard-line Northern Ireland Protestantleader who comforted relatives of the injured on a special flightfrom Belfast, also said sabotage should not be ruled out.   ``It is very suspicious looking because this flight is used byservicemen,'' he said.
Received from server -->   While soldiers are a frequent target of Irish guerrillas in
Received from server -->Northern Ireland, civilian airliners have never been known to be
Received from server -->attacked.   Authorities said 25 soldiers stationed in Northern Ireland were
Received from server -->on the flight. Four died, along with at least two Northern Irelandpolice officers.   Investigators searched the wreckage and recovered the flight
Received from server -->recorders Monday. Investigators from Boeing and General Electric
Received from server -->flew here to help in the inquiry.
Received from server -->   Passengers had just been served a light dinner when the plane gotinto trouble shortly after leaving London's Heathrow Airport.   Gareth Jones, 38, said some women passengers wept as the pilottold them: ``Prepare for a crash landing.''
Received from server -->   As the plane started descending on one engine, Jones said, sparksbegan flying from its remaining engine.
Received from server -->   Gilmore Stevenson, 45, told Mrs. Thatcher that it was ``very,very noisy. ``I'll never forget that noise. We had the sensation of
Received from server -->cartwheeling and I ended up hanging upside-down in my seatbelt. Iwas strung up like a turkey.''
Received from server -->   Stevenson said he agonized in the dark over whether to release
Received from server -->his seatbelt and risk being injured when he fell from his seat. Bythe time he decided to free himself, he hardly had the strength tolift his arm to the buckle.
Received from server -->   ``I eventually managed to release the belt and I fell down. It
Received from server -->was only a matter of feet _ I just lay there in a heap.''
Received from server -->   Stevenson said his wife, Vivienne, helped other passengers escape
Received from server -->and he was rescued by firefighters.</TEXT></DOC>

Received from server -->   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday allowedcriminal defendants to exclude potential jurors because of theirrace, clearing the way for an all-white jury in a case involving a
Received from server -->black man's murder by Ku Klux Klan members.
Received from server -->   The court, over two dissenting votes, rejected arguments byAlabama prosecutors _ supported by law enforcement officials
Received from server -->nationwide _ that defense lawyers unlawfully are seeking to barblacks from a jury in the Klan case in Mobile.
Received from server -->   Justices Byron R. White and Anthony M. Kennedy voted to hear
Received from server -->arguments in the case but four votes are needed to grant such review.
Received from server -->   Mobile County District Attorney Chris Galanos said defenselawyers should have to follow the same legal guidelines asprosecutors in not removing potential jurors simply because of thecolor of their skin. He also said it's ``absurd'' for defenselawyers to argue that black jurors cannot be fair to whitedefendants.   But Neil Hanley, a defense attorney in the Klan case, said the
Received from server -->Constitution prohibits ``governmental discrimination'' against
Received from server -->defendants and he was not surprised by the court's action.   ``I can strike whomever I please (from the jury), based on what'sin the best interest of my client,'' Hanley said. ``I've neverargued that blacks cannot give whites a fair trial.''
Received from server -->   Assistant Alabama Attorney General Ed Carnes said Monday that
Received from server -->Attorney General Don Siegelman instructed him to prepare legislationthat would make it a matter of state law that defense attorneyscould not discriminate on the basis of race.   Carnes said the Supreme Court, by declining to review the case,left open the possibility that such a state law may yet pass muster
Received from server -->if the issue reaches the high court again.
Received from server -->   The matter before the high court was whether a 1986 Supreme Courtruling against racial discrimination in jury selection applies to
Received from server -->defendants as well as prosecutors.   The court in 1986 ruled that prosecutors may not disqualify
Received from server -->potential jurors based on their race.
Received from server -->   The ruling, which overturned a black man's conviction by an
Received from server -->all-white jury in Kentucky, established that the Constitution'sequal-protection guarantees bar racially motivated jury selection byprosecutors. But the decision left unanswered whether the sameguarantees apply when defense lawyers seek to mold the racial
Received from server -->make-up of the jury.
Received from server -->   Monday's action involved the case of the March 21, 1981, killingof Michael Donald, 19, who was abducted from a Mobile street, beatento death and his body hanged from a tree.   Prosecutors said he was the random victim of a Klan hunting partyretaliating for a jury's inability to reach a verdict in the trialof a black man accused of murdering a white police officer.
Received from server -->   Two Klan members were convicted in the slaying. Henry FrancisHays was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. James ``Tiger''
Received from server -->Knowles pleaded guilty to a federal charge of violating Donald's
Received from server -->civil rights and was sentenced to life in prison.   Mobile County prosecutors then charged Hays' father, Bennie Jack
Received from server -->Hays, and Benjamin Franklin Cox with aiding and abetting the murder.
Received from server -->The elder Hays and Cox are former KKK members.
Received from server -->   An all-white jury had been impaneled. The defense attorneys had
Received from server -->disqualified all 16 blacks among 65 prospective jurors. But BennieHays collapsed in court last February, prompting a mistrial for both
Received from server -->defendants.   Before the retrial, prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court totest whether blacks may be excluded in a similar fashion again.   Mobile County Circuit Judge Michael E. Zoghby ruled last May that``under the law as it now exists, defendants do not have to give a
Received from server -->reason for the exercise of their peremptory challenges.'' TheAlabama Supreme Court refused to disturb the judge's decision.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>

Received from server --><DATELINE>PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An Australian duo Monday ended the debateover which college has the most persuasive students, winningdebating's most prestigious tournament for the University of Sydney
Received from server -->Union for the second time.
Received from server -->   The Sydney team triumphed over the University of Toronto and 114other pairs of word wizards to capture the 9th Annual WorldUniversities Debating Championship at Princeton University.   Two U.S. teams, from Yale University and the University ofPennsylvania, were eliminated in the semi-final round Monday morning.
Received from server -->   Using a forceful debating style mixed with wit, the Sydney team
Received from server -->was the clear crowd favorite as debaters Warren Lee and Andrew Bell
Received from server -->argued that modern society reveres those who acquire wealth.   University of Toronto team members Justin MacGregor and DavidConklin, acting as ``the government'' in the British parliamentarystyle argument, had the task of proving that ``it profits a mannothing to gain the world and lose his soul.''   ``It was a good debate,'' a confident Lee said after the
Received from server -->Australian team finished its work. ``The masses were laughing and
Received from server -->hooting and screaming. You always like to see that.''   Conklin admitted the subject ``was a tough one. Any value todayinvolving some notion of justice or injustice is difficult to getacross.''   In the debate, Conklin argued that figures such as Jesus, Gandhi
Received from server -->and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. shunned the material world for
Received from server -->larger social gains.   ``Christ, in his death, was far more important than he would have
Received from server -->been had he compromised his values,'' Conklin said.
Received from server -->   The Australian team, however, argued that today's society doesnot punish those who acquire wealth.   ``Let's look at the real world,'' Lee said. ``People don't say,`Let's all join the Peace Corps and be nice guys.'''
Received from server -->   MacGregor scored a few points by saying ``justice was served inthe movie `Wall Street.' Michael Douglas did go to jail in the end,
Received from server -->before he won his Academy Award.''   But it wasn't enough to overcome the Australians' contention
Received from server -->``that the people who get the stuff are not punished, they get thewealth, the repsect, and the happiness.''   Earlier in the day, the Australian team defeated the team fromYale University in the semi-finals by opposing the concept that
Received from server -->``the emperor has no clothes.''   The University of Toronto advanced to the championship round bydefeating the University of Pennsylvania with a successful argument
Received from server -->that the sky is not falling.
Received from server -->   The debating championship, held at Princeton University for the
Received from server -->second time in the tournament's nine-year history, drew a record 232participants from 18 nations.   The debaters have delivered some spirited arguments during the
Received from server -->week-long tournament.   For exampled, Cheryl Strauss of Cornell University last week
Received from server -->suggested that vegetables be the focal point of a new religion.   ``I think we should all pray to vegetables,'' she said. ``Then we
Received from server -->could all look down and that would make us feel good.''   Mark Voyce, a debater from the University of Maryland, had an

Received from server -->   The judge in the Iran-Contra case directed
Received from server -->Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Monday to certify that nationalsecurity concerns would prevent a fair public trial of the key
Received from server -->charges against former White House aide Oliver L. North.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said he would not grant
Received from server -->independent counsel Lawrence Walsh's motion to dismiss conspiracyand theft charges until the attorney general made clear in an
Received from server -->affidavit that the decision against allowing certain classifiedinformation to be released during any trial was made by high Reaganadministration officials.
Received from server -->   ``I have a question in my mind as to whether or not this is amotion that can only be made by the attorney general,'' Gesell saidat a hearing.   Walsh, who met with Thornburgh last Wednesday and told him he was
Received from server -->going to seek dismissal of the two central charges, said, ``I amquite sure I could get an affidavit'' from the attorney general.
Received from server -->Gesell said he hopes to receive it by Thursday.
Received from server -->   Justice Department spokesman Loye Miller declined to comment onwhether the attorney general would provide an affidavit, but a
Received from server -->department source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he
Received from server -->assumed the attorney general probably will submit one.   Meanwhile, Walsh disclosed he plans to call former U.S. Rep.Michael Barnes, D-Md., and beer magnate Joseph Coors to testify
Received from server -->against North. Their names were on a revised list of prosecutionwitnesses, which have been reduced in number from 87 to 40 becauseof the plans to dismiss the conspiracy and theft charges. Coors andBarnes weren't on the original list.
Received from server -->   Coors, after meeting with North in June 1985, provided a $65,000
Received from server -->donation to supply the Contras with a Maule aircraft and two monthslater Barnes inquired about North's activities on behalf of theContras. Barnes received a response denying that the NationalSecurity Council staff had provided fund-raising or military support
Received from server -->to the Contras.   North prepared the response, according to two counts in theindictment of the former National Security Council aide charging him
Received from server -->with obstruction of congress and making false statements. Barnes at
Received from server -->the time was chairman of the House subcommittee on westernhemisphere affairs.   Also among the new names on the prosecution's witness list isWilliam Langton, president of Southern Air Transport, a former CIAproprietary that was involved in both supplying the Contras and in
Received from server -->the administration's secret arms sales to Iran.   Walsh disclosed at the hearing that he acted to dismiss the twocounts last Thursday after receiving letters in December from
Received from server -->Thornburgh and CIA Director William Webster discussing the problem
Received from server -->of disclosing classified information in the North case.   The Dec. 22 attorney general's letter actually was written byAssistant Attorney General Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., head of the
Received from server -->criminal division, and noted that heads of intelligence agencies had
Received from server -->identified material that ``posed a substantial threat to national
Received from server -->security and could not be disclosed at trial.''   The decision represented ``the unanimous view of the intelligence
Received from server -->community,'' Dennis wrote. A copy of the letter was released at theJustice Department after Gesell's hearing.   Prosecutors asked Gesell Dec. 22 to reconsider his guidelines forpresenting classified information in prosecution exhibits. Thejudge's refusal last Tuesday to take that step triggered Walsh'strip to Thornburgh's office at the Justice Department, where the
Received from server -->indpendent counsel told the attorney general he would seek dismissalof the conspiracy and theft counts.   At the hearing, Walsh said his motion to dismiss was prompted bythe ``irresolution of the conflict'' with intelligence agencies overreleasing documents.   Gesell said that under the Classified Information Procedures Act,
Received from server -->the attorney general should represent the executive branch in
Received from server -->detailing problems that disclosing classified information would
Received from server -->present.   ``The decision of whether or not to release them seems to me tobe a high government responsibility and not a prosecutorialresponsibility,'' said Gesell.
Received from server -->   Gesell said the affidavit detailing the government's positionwould be presented to the court under seal.   North is still confronted with felony charges that could carryprison terms totaling as much as 60 years if he were to be convicted
Received from server -->on all counts.   These include obstructing various congressional and presidential
Received from server -->inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair by preparing false statementsand destroying documents.   The head of the prosecution team, John Keker, estimated it would
Received from server -->take six to eight weeks to present the government's case, whileNorth lawyer Brendan Sullivan estimated the defense part of the case
Received from server -->would take two to three months.
Received from server -->   ``It's going to be a wonderful summer,'' Gesell said.

The violence, the latest in the Shining Path guerrilla group'sbloody eight-year insurgency, occurred Sunday in remote areas of the
Received from server -->Andes Mountains.   Near Chaluanca, a town in Apurimac state 280 miles southeast of
Received from server -->Lima, a column of Shining Path ambushed the motorcade with automaticweapons and explosives, police said. They said a provincial courtjudge, a government attorney and three police guards were killed.   Police escorting the court officials to Chaluanca on state

Received from server -->   Officials said 20 Shining Path attacked the farming settlement of

Received from server -->   An Israeli hotel lost a kosher license becauseof a New Year's party involving a couple who simulated a sexual act
Received from server -->inside a flying helicopter hovering outside the hotel's windows, themanager said Monday.   Israeli newspapers said the couple was having sex in the
Received from server -->chopper's open doorway, and the daily Yediot carried a photograph
Received from server -->Monday showing a woman and a man who appeared engaged in a sexual
Received from server -->act in a helicopter.
Received from server -->   But Doron Gilboa of the Club Hotel in the city of Tiberias saidthe couple was in fact dressed and only simulated a sexual act.   ``They were wearing transparent clothes and only hugged, kissed
Received from server -->and fondled each other,'' he said. ``You cannot make love in thecold we had then, and what's more, inside a helicopter.''
Received from server -->   Gilboa told The Associated Press the entire hotel was rented for
Received from server -->a three-day private New Year party. He said an arrangement was made
Received from server -->with a man who offered a helicopter for a laser show.   ``Apparently, something went wrong and the man decided to bring apair of performers. He acted without our approval, and we are
Received from server -->considering taking steps against him,'' Gilboa said.   On Jan. 2, Gilboa said, Tiberias Chief Rabbi David Peretz told

Received from server -->   A homeless man was arrested Monday in thestrangulation and rape of a pregnant pathologist in her city
Received from server -->hospital office. The suspect sometimes lived at the hospital andmasqueraded as an employee, police said.
Received from server -->   Steven Smith, 23, was found by police at a shelter Monday after
Received from server -->three other homeless men came forward with the doctor's personal
Received from server -->property and said Smith had given it to them, Police CommissionerBenjamin Ward said.
Received from server -->   Smith was charged with murder, robbery and rape in the death ofDr. Kathryn Hinnant, 33, Ward said.   The city had offered a $30,000 reward for information about theslaying, which Mayor Edward I. Koch called ``the No. 1 case to besolved.''
Received from server -->   Ms. Hinnant's body was found early Sunday by her husband and a
Received from server -->hospital administrator. The pathologist was five months pregnant and
Received from server -->the medical examiner determined that her death was due tostrangulation.   Ward said Smith allegedly gave Ms. Hinnant's mink jacket to
Received from server -->another man to sell, Ward said. Police said the doctor was robbed ofa wristwatch, $50 to $75 and the coat.   Smith told investigators that he and another man named John hadgone to the fourth floor of Bellevue Hospital and attacked Ms.
Received from server -->Hinnant, Ward said. However, the commissioner said, Smith put theonus of the attack on John, including the rape.
Received from server -->   ``We have not even confirmed that this person lived other than inthe mind of Steven Smith,'' Ward said.   Investigators also found bloodstained hospital garments in a
Received from server -->garbage container near the Wards Island men's shelter where theyfound Smith, Ward said.
Received from server -->   Smith told police that he sometimes lived at Bellevue and had abed on the 22nd floor, and would wander through the hospital withoutproblems while wearing a stethoscope and hospital garb, Ward said.
Received from server -->   Chief of Detectives Robert Colangelo went to the floor, a
Received from server -->maintenance and machinery area, and confirmed that there was a``lone, dirty bed,'' empty beer cans and a stethoscope, the
Received from server -->commissioner said.   Ward called it ``a crime of opportunity,'' adding that Smith's
Received from server -->``normal behavior when he is at the hospital is to steal IDs'' andeat at the hospital cafeteria.   Ms. Hinnant, who had been working at the hospital on her day off
Received from server -->to prepare a lecture she was to deliver Monday, was rememberedfondly by colleagues.
Received from server -->   Hinnant came in on Saturday ``because she was always looking forthis extra mile and that extra piece of excellence she could give,''
Received from server -->said Dr. John Pearson, director of pathology at the hospital.   About 50 detectives were assigned to the case, as a debate over
Received from server -->Bellevue security raged.
Received from server -->   ``Security here isn't the tightest. It seems like anyone can walkin,'' said an intern, Dr. Jane Skorina. But she said the attack was
Received from server -->``an isolated incident and doesn't affect what may happen in the
Received from server -->future.''   A social worker supervisor, who asked for anonymity, said thatwhen she once came in on a Saturday she found it ``quite
Received from server -->frightening. I felt quite vulnerable. There are no people around,even the elevators are lonely.''   Dr. Jo Ivey Boufford, president of the Health and Hospitals
Received from server -->Corp., said security at the 1,200-bed hospital complex would bereviewed, but an initial check found nothing out of the ordinary atthe time of the murder.</TEXT>

Received from server --><TEXT>   Costa Rica announced on Monday the
Received from server -->indefinite postponement of a Central American summit scheduled forJan. 15-16 to discuss a regional peace plan.   ``There definitely will not be a meeting of presidents,'' Foreign
Received from server -->Minister Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto told a news conference in San Jose,the capital. He said three of the five presidents involved _ the
Received from server -->presidents of Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica _ had agreed tothe suspension.
Received from server -->   The other two countries are Nicaragua and Guatemala.
Received from server -->   ``The new date will be negotiated, adjusting the agendas of the
Received from server -->presidents and of the foreign ministers,'' Madrigal Nieto said.
Received from server -->   He said the summit may take place in February. Foreign ministersof the five governments will meet in the Nicaraguan capital of
Received from server -->Managua Jan. 17-18, he said.
Received from server -->   Nicaragua said the summit should be held as scheduled rather thandelayed as Costa Rican President Oscar Arias suggested.   But Foreign Minister Ricardo Acevedo of El Salvador saidPresident Jose Napoleon Duarte believed it could be held on schedule
Received from server -->only if presidents of all five countries agreed.   On Friday, Arias suggested postponing the meeting to givePresident-elect George Bush time to formulate a Central American
Received from server -->policy. Bush takes office Jan. 20.   Madrigal Nieto denied that postponement could jeopardize the
Received from server -->Central American peace plan authored by Arias and signed by the five
Received from server -->presidents in Guatemala City in August 1987.   The plan, which won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for Arias, calls
Received from server -->for greater democracy, an end to civil wars, political amnesties and
Received from server -->an end to the use of one country by rebels fighting in another.
Received from server -->   The pln has been stalled since the presidents last met in January
Received from server -->1988 in Costa Rica.
Received from server -->   ``What we want is not to hold up Esquipulas II, but to soorganize it that it can give better results than achieved so far,''
Received from server -->Madrigal Nieto said.
Received from server -->   He was referring to the name commonly used for the peace plan,
Received from server -->arising from the Guatemalan town where a key, early peace meetingwas held.   He said the original decision to hold a summit on Jan. 15-16 wastaken ``in a moment of euphoria, as if Central America didn't have
Received from server -->conflicts or obstacles that could intervene in achieving betterresults.''   Madrigal Nieto said committees set up to monitor compliance with
Received from server -->the peace plan would have been unable to overcome differences among
Received from server -->the governments before the original summit date.   In Managua, President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua telephoned Ariason Sunday to express ``his concern about the postponement,''
Received from server -->Ortega's press office said Monday.
Received from server -->   Ortega said last week that postponing the meeting ``could mean
Received from server -->the death'' of the Central American peace plan.
Received from server -->   A Costa Rican Foreign Ministry official called Ortega's statement``out of line.''   Ortega insisted late Monday that the summit was not postponed. Hesaid on state-run Nicaraguan radio that any move to delay themeeting ``will be through a definite decision made by us, all the
Received from server -->Central American presidents.''   But he added: ``In case the meeting isn't held then, it must beheld as soon as possible.''   Ortega also said deputy foreign ministers from the fivegovernments would meet on Tuesday in Managua, the Nicaraguancapital, to work out a summit agenda.   Guatemala also has said it opposed delaying the meeting.
Received from server -->   Honduras has not commented. President Jose Azcona Hoyo traveled
Received from server -->to Washington on Monday and will meet Tuesday with President Reaganand Bush.
Received from server -->   Acevedo said Jan. 29-30 or Feb. 20 were being considered asalternate dates.
Received from server -->   A technical preparatory meeting should be held as scheduled on
Received from server -->Tuesday and a foreign ministers' meeting could be scheduled for Jan.17-18, he said.

Received from server -->   ``Both sides have agreed it (the Cambodian problem) will besolved soon ... by September 1989 within the framework of apolitical settlement,'' said Thach, who is also deputy premier.   Asked whether peace in Cambodia was at hand, Thach toldreporters, ``Peace would be at hand during the first six months of
Received from server -->1989.''   Siddhi, the highest-ranking Thai official to visit Vietnam since
Received from server -->1976, arrived Monday for a four-day visit. His talks with Thach were
Received from server -->to continue Tuesday.
Received from server -->   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to oust the Khmer Rouge,
Received from server -->whose brutal four-year rule saw hundreds of thousands of Cambodiansdie from executions and famine.
Received from server -->   The Khmer Rouge is the strongest member of a three-partyresistance coalition battling the Soviet-backed Vietnamese. Chinaand Thailand back the coalition, and the United States supports thetwo non-communist groups in it.
Received from server -->   Fears of the Khmer Rouge returning to power have grown as Vietnamannounced a partial withdrawal from Cambodia. Vietnam has said itwill pull out all its troops by the end of this year.
Received from server -->   President Heng Samrin, president of Cambodia's Vietnam-installedgovernment, said last week that 50,000 Vietnamese troops are in
Received from server -->Cambodia, but Western intelligence officials estimate the number at
Received from server -->about 65,000. Guerrillas say 120,000 Vietnamese troops are in thecountry.   Armed guerrilla strength is estimated at about 47,000.   Siddhi was also scheduled to hold talks with Vietnam's Communist
Received from server -->Party chief, Nguyen Van Linh, and Premier Do Muoi.   The Thai foreign minister is paving the way for a trip to Vietnam
Received from server -->by Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan, who has pledged to transformIndochina from a battlefield into a trading market.   Last week, the Cambodian government suggested the troops could
Received from server -->withdraw by September if Thailand denies sanctuary to Cambodian
Received from server -->guerrillas and countries halt weapons supplies and other aid to theresistance.   Calling Siddhi's trip to Vietnam a ``good sign,'' Vietnam's
Received from server -->Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Ho The Lan, told reporters the agenda
Received from server -->was open and that Thach was ``ready to discuss everything.''
Received from server -->   She listed as topics Cambodian peace talks, concerns over theKhmer Rouge retaking power and the surge of Vietnamese ``boatpeople'' refugees into Southeast Asian countries.   The peace talks would involve Cambodia, the guerrilla groups,
Received from server -->Vietnam, Laos and the six-member Association of Southeast Asian
Received from server -->Nations. Association members are Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia,Indonesia, the Philippines and Brunei.
Received from server -->   Accompanying Siddhi was a 62-member delegation that includedbankers, investors and businessmen. Its members were to hold talks
Received from server -->with officials of Vietnam's State Commission for Foreign Investment,the Ministry of External Economic Relations and Vietnam's commercialbank.

Received from server -->future of the airline, a subsidiary of Houston-based Texas Air Corp.   Machinists District 100 President Charles E. Bryan accusedEastern of sabotaging the mediation by releasing statements on the
Received from server -->talks to employees in what he called a violation of a news blackouton the sessions. He also alleged Eastern failed to bargain in goodfaith.
Received from server -->   Bryan called the airline's actions ``unethical, withoutprinciple, deceptive.'' He said the company was ``determined toforce a strike.''
Received from server -->   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said Miami television stationsdiscovered the location of the talks and began covering them Friday.Matell said the daily employee bulletins, which were obtained by
Received from server -->reporters, were not a violation of the news blackout.   Bill Gill, assistant executive director of the mediation board,said he did not know all the reasons behind Wallace's decision and
Received from server -->declined to comment. Harry Bickford, another federal mediator at thetalks, also declined to comment.
Received from server -->   Citing huge losses and high operating costs, Eastern is seekingmajor wage cuts from the union. The 8,500 mechanics, baggagehandlers and other ground service workers comprise more than
Received from server -->one-fourth of Eastern's payroll.   ``The end of talks is certainly a major disappointment withserious implications about Eastern's future,'' said Joseph B.
Received from server -->Leonard, Eastern's executive vice president and chief operatingofficer.   ``These talks have dragged on for more than 15 months, drainingEastern's strength with each passing day. We desperately need the
Received from server -->government to provide a process to resolve this dispute within 30days,'' he said.   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said Miami television stations had
Received from server -->discovered the location of the talks and began covering them Friday.Matell said employee bulletins about the talks that were put out
Received from server -->daily by Eastern, and were obtained by reporters, weren't aviolation of the blackout on information about the talks.   Charles E. Bryan, president of District 100 of the Machinists
Received from server -->union, declined comment until a news conference, scheduled laterMonday.   Eastern has been pressing for a federal declaration of an impasse
Received from server -->in the negotiations, which would begin a 30-day cooling-off period.After that, the union could strike and the company could impose itsown work conditions on the union members.
Received from server -->   The union has claimed that Eastern wants to provoke a strike soit can try to break it and bust the union.   Wallace joined mediator Harry Bickford on Friday in an effort to
Received from server -->get the talks moving, but sources speaking on condition of anonymitysaid there was virtually no progress.
Received from server -->   The two sides, who last met in intense mediation in July, havebeen about $200 million apart. The Machinists were seeking a $50million raise, while Eastern was seeking $150 million in
Received from server -->concessions, mostly from the non-mechanics represented by the union.   Eastern reported $233.7 million in losses for the first threequarters of 1988. Texas Air Corp. also owns non-union Continental

Received from server -->   President Manuel Solis Palma on Mondayled a parade through the capital to mark the 25th anniversary ofstudent clashes with U.S. military personnel that left 23 dead and
Received from server -->hundreds injured.   As he led thousands of marchers, including members of hisCabinet, other government officials, armed civilian militia and
Received from server -->Defense Forces troops, Solis Palma told reporters the demonstrationwas ``a message of warning, but not of aggression'' to the UnitedStates.
Received from server -->   On Dec. 9, 1964, thousands of students protesting U.S. ownershipof the Panama Canal mobbed the former canal zone and tried to raise
Received from server -->Panamanian flags over U.S. installations. American troops fired intothe crowd, killing 23 Panamanians.   Panama temporarily broke diplomatic relations with the United
Received from server -->States over the incident. It prompted negotiations that eventuallyled to the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties, under which the United States
Received from server -->is to turn over control of the waterway on Dec. 31, 1999.
Received from server -->   Relations reached a new low last year after two federal grandjuries in the United States indicted Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
Received from server -->Panama's Defense Forces commander and de facto leader, on drugtrafficking and money laundering charges.
Received from server -->   In February, then-President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fireNoriega, who instead engineered Delvalle's ouster by the National
Received from server -->Assembly and replaced him with Solis Palma. The United States stillrecognizes Delvalle as president
Received from server -->   The Reagan administration imposed diplomatic and economicsanctions against Panama in a bid to force Noriega to resign.
Received from server -->Noriega denies the drug trafficking charges and alleges the UnitedStates is attempting to abrogate the 1977 canal treaties.
Received from server -->   Demonstrators began their three-mile march Monday at theLegislative Park, site of the 1964 shootings, and carried banners
Received from server -->that read, ``Unity and Struggle in Defense of the Nation'' and``Until the Year 2000 with Dignity.'' Civilian militias who were
Received from server -->organized by the Defense Forces last March to repel a possible U.S.invasion carried rifles, grenade launchers and submachine guns.
Received from server -->   Noriega did not participate in the march.   Dozens of foreign diplomats attended a commemorative ceremony at

Received from server -->   Scores of makeshift tents blew in thechilly wind Monday alongside piles of garbage and donated clothing,
Received from server -->but few homeless Central Americans remained at the crude camp thatmoved a federal judge to put an immigration policy on hold.
Received from server -->   Facing eviction from their shantytown, hundreds of aliens who hadset up camp in Brownsville left their tents for shelter in nearby
Received from server -->churches or for other cities.   The camp had mushroomed in the wake of a Dec. 16 policy change by
Received from server -->the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which required thealiens to stay in south Texas while they applied for political
Received from server -->asylum.   But the exodus began even before U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela
Received from server -->issued a temporary restraining order Monday against the INS,allowing the asylum-seekers once again to leave south Texas.
Received from server -->   Many started looking for places to go Sunday after the campsiteproperty owner posted ``No Trespassing'' signs and the Cameron
Received from server -->County sheriff ordered everyone off the property within 24 hours. OnMonday the deadline was extended another day.
Received from server -->   ``If I just go out there and put them on the street, it's goingto place a bigger burden on everybody,'' said Sheriff Alex Perez.
Received from server -->   But most of the aliens already had found other shelter fromweather that turned cold and rainy. Many stayed in churches.
Received from server -->   As the north wind picked up speed and drizzle continued Mondayafternoon, only a few stragglers remained at the trash-covered lot.
Received from server -->By late Monday, only about 50 campers remained in their lean-toshelters, and many said they did not plan to stay the night.
Received from server -->   Area residents, however, continued to bring food and clothing.   ``These are my brothers and sisters in Christ and this is what I
Received from server -->have to do,'' said Mary Mortimore, 68, of Plankinton, S.D., who withher husband made one of many deliveries of clothing. ``I can't
Received from server -->believe the devastation here.''   So much clothing was donated that piles of unused shirts, pants,
Received from server -->coats and shoes were scattered over the campsite. Those who leftcould not carry it all with them.
Received from server -->   Other people brought hot food.   ``If we don't feed them, who will?'' asked Fidela Gomez, 55, of
Received from server -->Brownsville, who fed egg and potato tacos and coffee to a long lineof Central Americans Sunday night. ``God doesn't make exceptions
Received from server -->between people. We're all equal in his eyes.''   ``I'm thankful to the people of Brownsville,'' said Eliseo
Received from server -->Enriquez, 30, a Honduran who spent two weeks in the camp. He andeight relatives said Monday they were heading for Houston, where
Received from server -->they have family members to help them.   Life has been difficult in the shantytown.   Some people lived under sheets of clear plastic held up by tree
Received from server -->limbs, while others stayed in real tents. The most majesticstructure on the site is a 15-by-15-foot house of wood, cardboard
Received from server -->and tar paper, built by 15 Nicaraguans and equipped with separaterooms for men and women.
Received from server -->   ``You want to buy it?'' asked Vidal Sanchez, 38, a Nicaraguan whohad stayed there, but chose to leave. He was heading for a nearby
Received from server -->Mennonite church, Iglesia Menonita del Cordero, which opened itsauditorium to the immigrants when the cold front hit.

Received from server -->   The pilot said there was no need to beunduly concerned, but some of the passengers only had to look out
Received from server -->their window at a flaming engine to know something was very wrong.   A short time later, the British Midland Airways Boeing 737 hitthe ground in what one passenger said was a ``shuddering crash ...
Received from server -->like a massive motorcar accident.''   The plane was less than 15 minutes into a London-Belfast flight
Received from server -->Sunday when Dr. John McCrea looked out of the window and ``sawflames and flashes coming out of the engine.''
Received from server -->   Minutes later, veteran pilot Kevin Hunt told passengers toprepare for an emergency landing at East Midlands Airport in central
Received from server -->England. The jet crashed short of the runway.   McCrea and his wife, Josephine, were returning to their Belfasthome Sunday night from a trip to London.   ``We had been on the plane for 10 or 12 minutes and they were
Received from server -->serving light meals,'' McCrea said Monday from his bed in DerbyRoyal Infirmary, his right arm in a sling.
Received from server -->   ``I felt a shudder and I looked over at the left wing,'' he said,and the cabin crew stopped the meal service.   ``The pilot announced that we were not to be unduly concerned,
Received from server -->but I began to wonder what was happening,'' said McCrea, 38. Twogirls started to scream, and ``there were more more flames in the
Received from server -->sky.''
Received from server -->   ``We went on flying for a further five minutes,'' he said. ``The
Received from server -->plane seemed to drop. We lost height.''
Received from server -->   Soon, he could see lights on the highway below.
Received from server -->   ``We carried on two or three minutes and there were more flashes
Received from server -->over the left side of the plane,'' he said. ``The cabin staff weremoving up and down securing all the baggage in the lockers.''   McCrea read the safety instructions and told his wife to brace
Received from server -->herself. ``I said it could be bumpy. We carried on flying. Therewere more flashes and more of what I thought was turbulence.
Received from server -->   ``Not long afterward the captain came on the public address andtold us to prepare for an emergency landing. It seemed like onlyfive seconds later we were down.''   Passenger Gareth Jones said women wept after the pilot's warning.
Received from server -->   As the plane started its descent, Jones said he saw sparks fly
Received from server -->from one engine, as he had earlier in the flight. The impact waslike a ``shuddering crash ... It was like a massive motorcaraccident ... crunch ... blackness.''   Jones, a 38-year-old government employee who suffered bad
Received from server -->bruises, said he held the hand of the distraught woman next to himduring the rapid descent.
Received from server -->   ``The lady next to me ... was obviously very distressed. When thefirst engine went she started crying and held my hand. I tried to
Received from server -->joke about how these things could fly on one engine and glidedown,'' he said.
Received from server -->   ``Then the second engine went and she gripped my hand and I saidthere was no way we were not getting out of that plane together,''Jones said. ``I knew if I showed I had any fear she would have beenworse.''
Received from server -->   ``When we hit the ground there was a massive crash _ like amultiple car accident _ and because we were right next to theemergency hatch I could see a tree outside and knew we had hit the
Received from server -->ground and must get out,'' Jones later was quoted as saying by TheTimes of London newspaper in its Tuesday issue.
Received from server -->   ``I pulled the emergency exit handle and pulled out the lady nextto me. I saw we were standing on the motorway and got to my feet,
Received from server -->but they immediately gave way and I fell down again,'' he said.   He gave no further details in the interview about what happened
Received from server -->to the woman after they left the plane.   Nick Stevenson, who suffered a broken leg, said that when the
Received from server -->first engine failed, the plane started losing altitude.   ``Then the other engine started producing strange noises ... Aswe came in on the approach run it started spluttering and then just
Received from server -->stopped and we knew we were going to hit the deck,'' he said.   McCrea said that when the plane crashed, ``people were moaning
Received from server -->and someone said `My legs hurt.' Another voice said `Please helpme.'''   He said the man sitting next to him helped pull his wife from the
Received from server -->wreckage.   ``It seemed only a minute later and someone was crashing the
Received from server -->windows in over the wing ... I think I was the third person off theplane.''   Firefighters doused the plane with foam. ``My suit was soaked and
Received from server -->it was slippery underfoot,'' said McCrea.   Mrs. McCrea, 38, who suffered hip and leg injuries, said sheprayed as the plane fell.
Received from server -->   ``There wasn't time really to panic or worry about it,'' she
Received from server -->said. ``The pilot told us to prepare for a crash-landing _ that'swhat we did.''
Received from server -->   Asked if she feared she was going to die, she replied: ``I justsaid my prayers and got on with it. There was nothing else to do.''
Received from server -->   At nearby Leicester Royal Infirmary, Alistair McCrory, 43, ofDownpatrick, County Down, said that after his narrow escape he
Received from server -->telephoned his girlfriend, Pat Miles, and proposed marriage.   ``She has said yes,'' he said.

Received from server -->   A judge on Monday blocked a new
Received from server -->government immigration policy blamed for forcing hundreds ofhomeless Central Americans in south Texas to live in primitive camps
Received from server -->and condemned buildings.   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela's temporary restraining order
Received from server -->restores a previous Immigration and Naturalization Service policythat allows asylum seekers in south Texas to travel to other U.S.
Received from server -->destinations after checking in with the INS.
Received from server -->   Hundreds of the asylum-seekers have camped out in Cameron County,Texas' southernmost county, since the INS adopted a policy Dec. 16
Received from server -->that all but prevented them from leaving the area while theirapplications for political asylum were processed.
Received from server -->   ``One would have to be blind not to recognize that we have aproblem,'' Vela said, in putting the INS policy on hold.
Received from server -->   The temporary restraining order was sought in a lawsuit filed
Received from server -->against the INS on Friday by refugee advocates.   ``Everybody is euphoric about the good news,'' said Vidal
Received from server -->Sanchez, 38, of Nicaragua, who has lived for more than two weeks ina primitive camp near Brownsville with more than 300 other Central
Received from server -->Americans awaiting appointments with the INS.   Sanchez said he planned to leave for Miami by Wednesday.
Received from server -->   He and other campers, many staying under tents fashioned from
Received from server -->tree limbs and discarded sheets of plastic, were told Sunday theywould have to vacate the land after the property owner posted ``No
Received from server -->Trespassing'' signs.   The campsite's population continued to drop Monday as the
Received from server -->immigrants complied with a sheriff's order to leave or facetrespassing charges. The aliens have been offered shelter in several
Received from server -->nearby churches.
Received from server -->   By late Monday, only about 50 Central Americans were living inthe camp, and many said they did not plan to spend the night.
Received from server -->   The shantytown is across the street from the CatholicChurch-operated Casa Oscar Romero shelter for Central Americans,
Received from server -->which for months has been filled to its court-ordered maximumoccupancy of 200.
Received from server -->   U.S. Rep. Solomon Ortiz, D-Texas, announced Monday that he hadobtained assurances of immediate federal assistance for Cameron
Received from server -->County in providing food and shelter for the influx of CentralAmericans.
Received from server -->   Ortiz said he and a team from the Justice Department's community
Received from server -->relations service would tour the county and make recommendations forimmediate action.
Received from server -->   Ortiz said the ideal situation would be to make use of existingspace in federal buildings.
Received from server -->   Vela's temporary restraining order will be in effect untilThursday, when the judge scheduled a hearing to decide whether to
Received from server -->issue an indefinite preliminary injunction against the new INSprocedure.
Received from server -->   Vern Jervis, an INS spokesman in Washington, said the agency will
Received from server -->contest the restraining order.   The INS policy, which applies to any district where aliens apply
Received from server -->for asylum, was defended Monday by attorney David Ayala.   ``Your honor, the immigration service is not to blame for the
Received from server -->plight of the people who are out there,'' Ayala told the judge.   Jervis said the new procedure was designed to curb abuses of the
Received from server -->asylum process that created backlogs of thousands of cases in some
Received from server -->cities. More than 30,000 asylum-seekers passed through the INSHarlingen District at the southern tip of Texas last year.
Received from server -->   Most asylum applicants do not qualify for refugee status, Jervissaid, because they are here for economic, not political reasons.
Received from server -->   Under the Dec. 16 policy, INS officials were telling applicants
Received from server -->they could not travel from the area or work while awaiting adecision on their asylum status, a period of at least 30 days.
Received from server -->   After Vela's order, the victorious immigration attorneys went totell the aliens of their changed status.
Received from server -->   ``We're going to advise people that they do not have to live herein the (Rio Grande) valley in the rain and the cold and vacant lots,
Received from server -->that they can now be with their family, with their friends and they
Received from server -->can pursue their asylum claims in those (destination) cities,'' saidMark Schneider, an attorney with Proyecto Libertad, a co-counsel to
Received from server -->the lawsuit.   ``It's marvelous,'' said Maria Isabel Fernandez, 28, of Honduras,
Received from server -->who has camped for two weeks near Casa Romero. ``What else could weask for?''
Received from server -->   She and eight relatives said they planned to travel to Houston,where they have family.
Received from server -->   Sister Juliana Garcia, director of Casa Romero, said many people
Received from server -->at the shelter started preparing to travel as soon as they heardabout the court order.
Received from server -->   ``I think it will alleviate the situation for a lot of people,''Sister Juliana said. ``People are already making a big line to fix
Received from server -->their papers and leave.''   The lawsuit against INS Commissioner Alan Nelson and U.S.Attorney General Richard Thornburgh was filed by Brownsville
Received from server -->immigration attorney Linda Reyna Yanez, Robert Rubin of the SanFrancisco Lawyers' Committee for Urban Affairs and the
Received from server -->Harlingen-based Proyecto Libertad immigrant legal advocacy office.   It accuses the INS of implementing a policy change without
Received from server -->publishing it in the Federal Register for public comment, and ofdepriving asylum-seekers of their rights to representation and
Received from server -->access to the asylum process as required by U.S. law under theRefugee Act of 1980.</TEXT></DOC>

Received from server -->   Federal judicial police arrested Gilberto Ontiveros Lucero andheld him in a federal jail in Juarez, said Alfonso Sanchez Gallo, a

Received from server --><BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pat Sajak got well wishes from rivals JohnnyCarson and David Letterman on the debut Monday of his CBS late-nighttalk show, and he joked that he received a phone call from President
Received from server -->Reagan.
Received from server -->   ``He called to wish me well in the Super Bowl,'' Sajak said inhis opening monologue of ``The Pat Sajak Show.''   Sajak found himself the opening night recipient of a big kiss
Received from server -->from Morganna, the chesty media-wise kissing bandit who frequentsmajor sports events to buss and tell.
Received from server -->   He told Morganna, who usually reserves her kisses for sports
Received from server -->stars, ``I'm not a jock, but I do wear one.''   Sajak said he didn't get much sleep because he had a weird dreamthat Time magazine had named Earth as Planet of the Year.   ``I dreamed the Earth was disqualified because it was the home of
Received from server -->Morton Downey Jr.,'' he said.
Received from server -->   Sajak introduced his bandleader, Tom Scott, and sidekick, DanMiller, a former colleague he worked with in Nashville.   Sajak's desk was before an open window with a set backdrop of the
Received from server -->Los Angeles skyline.   Sajak asked Miller if he knew what his job was and Miller said
Received from server -->``Yes. It's to move three feet over on the couch each time a newguest comes out.''   The first guest, Chevy Chase, turned to Miller and said, ``Ed,
Received from server -->good to see you,'' a reference to Carson sidekick Ed McMahon.   Other scheduled guests were Joan Van Ark, Michael Gross and theJudds.
Received from server -->   Earlier, Letterman called Sajak, an occasional guest on his NewYork-based show, to offer congratulations and wish him good luck,
Received from server -->Bob Burton, a spokesman for Sajak, said.   Burton said Sajak had also heard from Carson, but he did not knowif the host of NBC's ``The Tonight Show,'' had called personally.
Received from server -->Regular substitute host Jay Leno was filling in for Carson, who hasbested more than a score of competitors since becoming host of``Tonight'' in 1962.
Received from server -->   ``Thicke of the Night,'' a syndicated series starring Alan Thickein 1983, was ballyhooed as a show that would take Carson down a
Received from server -->notch or two. It lasted less than a year.   ``The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers'' was a personal rivalrythat inspired bitterness on both sides. Carson said he was offended
Received from server -->that Rivers, who had been permanent substitute host of ``The TonightShow,'' had not told him in advance she was leaving to become hostof the Fox Broadcasting Show in 1986. She left the show after about
Received from server -->six months because of poor ratings and the show expired severalmonths later.
Received from server -->   Sajak's nightly 90-minute show will compete in most citiesagainst the one-hour ``Tonight Show'' and the first half of ``LateNight with David Letterman'' on NBC. It's CBS' first talk show since
Received from server -->Merv Griffin left the airwaves in 1972 as another victim of therivalry against Carson.

Received from server -->1986.   Nathalie Menigon, 31, and Joelle Aubron 28, of the group DirectAction, are charged with murder. Jean-Marc Rouillan, 33, and Georges
Received from server -->Cipriani, 38, are charged with complicity.   The four, surrounded by 10 guards, appeared before a special
Received from server -->seven-judge panel. They refused to stand as the judges entered thecourtroom where Besse's widow and her five children sat with new
Received from server -->Renault chief Raymond Levy.   They face maximum terms of life in prison if convicted.   On Feb. 11, 1987, Direct Action claimed responsibility for the
Received from server -->murder in letters sent to news organizations in Paris. The letterssaid the killing resulted from a ``world clash between the
Received from server -->international proletariat and the imperialist bourgeoisie.''   The four were convicted last February of criminal association,receiving 10-year sentences. Menigon also drew 12 years for the
Received from server -->attempted murder of two policemen in 1983.   Defense lawyers on Monday complained the four were held in

Received from server --><DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Emperor Hirohito's regret over his role in
Received from server -->World War II made him feel unworthy as a father, a former tutor ofhis son and successor, Emperor Akihito, said Monday.
Received from server -->   Elizabeth Gray Vining said from her home in suburban KennettSquare, Pa., the topic came up during one of two hourlong
Received from server -->conversations she had about Akihito's education with the emperor andEmpress Nagako during the four years she taught English to theprince.
Received from server -->   She said Hirohito at the time saw his son only on weekends andnot necessarily every weekend.   ``I spoke very frankly,'' said Mrs. Vining, 86, an author of 25
Received from server -->books. ``I said I thought that the crown prince was very devoted tohis father and that he wanted to see his father more often.''   Hirohito ``then said that he hadn't felt worthy because he hadn't
Received from server -->been able to prevent the war,'' she said.   Hirohito, 87, died of intestinal cancer Friday without ever
Received from server -->shedding much light on his role during World War II. Historiansgenerally agree he was a figurehead who was required to approvedecisions of the military leaders, until he decided the Japanese had
Received from server -->suffered enough and personally announced surrender in August 1945.   Mrs. Vining said she did not know whether Hirohito spent more
Received from server -->time with his son after her conversation with him early in 1949.   Mrs. Vining, who had worked with the Philadelphia-based Quakerpeace organization, the American Friends Service Committee, became
Received from server -->Akihito's tutor in October 1946 when the crown prince was nearly 13and continued in that role until December 1950.   The American Friends Service Committee nominated her for the job,and several factors led to her selection, she said.   ``The fact that I was a widow, that I had known sorrow, wasimportant to the decision,'' she said. ``And the fact that I hadtraveled in Europe, and the fact that I was a Quaker and Quakers areknown to stand for peace.'' Her husband had died in an automobile
Received from server -->accident.   Mrs. Vining has been back to Japan four times since her years asAkihito's tutor. She saw Akihito and his wife, Michiko, most
Received from server -->recently during the couple's visit last year to the United States.   ``I think he won't be a copy of his father,'' Mrs. Vining said.
Received from server -->``He'll be his own man. For one thing, he's been in England. He'smet the royal family there.''   From that experience, he has an understanding of how a
Received from server -->constitutional monarchy works, she said.</TEXT>

Received from server --><DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
Received from server --><TEXT>   Engines on the Boeing 737 that crashed in England,killing at least 43 people, had parts that were not properly tested,said a lawyer who sued the engine's maker four months ago.
Received from server -->   But a spokesman for General Electric Co., which manufactures the
Received from server -->engine in a consortium with the French company SNECMA, said engines
Received from server -->on the plane had checked out as normal.   Attorney Jim Helmer of Cincinnati, in a telephone interview with
Received from server -->The Associated Press, identified the allegedly faulty parts as timervalves. He said he didn't know if the parts could have caused Sunday
Received from server -->night's crash.
Received from server -->   ``We have verified that the CFM-56 engines did have timer valves
Received from server -->on them that were produced in Seattle, and that the timer valveswere not produced according to specifications,'' Helmer said.
Received from server -->   A GE spokesman in Cincinnati disputed whether there were anyfaulty parts that could have caused the crash.
Received from server -->   ``We've gone back and looked at the records of both engines onthe British Midland plane. And the engines, under tests, performed
Received from server -->normally,'' said Dwight Weber.
Received from server -->   ``This included the aircraft flight acceptance tests. At no timeduring these tests did any of these engines display any
Received from server -->characteristics that would indicate malfunction of timer assembly,''he said.
Received from server -->   ``Also, in a malfunction of a timer assembly, the most extreme
Received from server -->result would be an increase of temperature of the engine exhaust gastemperature of up to 20 degrees centigrade. That's well within the
Received from server -->operating limits of the engines in question,'' Weber said.
Received from server -->   Helmer's suit was filed in September in U.S. District Court inCincinnati but was not unsealed until Friday. It alleges violations
Received from server -->of the False Claims Act and was aimed primarily at militaryaircraft, Helmer said.
Received from server -->   The suit alleged that General Electric's airplane engine facility
Received from server -->in Seattle failed to properly test parts until sometime in 1987 whenthe testimg program was corrected.
Received from server -->   Helmer told The Associated Press the parts were also used in the
Received from server -->type of engine installed in Boeing 737s.
Received from server -->   Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Jack Gamble declined tocomment on the engine parts.
Received from server -->   The 737-400 model involved in the crash had been delivered toBritish Midland Airways 12 weeks ago. It had 500 hours of service.
Received from server -->   Helmer is representing Anthony DiVincenzo, a former plant manger
Received from server -->at General Electric's aircraft division facility in Seattle.
Received from server -->   The False Claims Act allows citizens to sue defense contractorswhen contractors receive payments pursuant to falsified standards.
Received from server -->   DiVencenzo maintains through Helmer's suit that General Electricwas required to do certain tests on these parts and that they didnot do the tests or did not do them completely but still certifiedthey had done the test.
Received from server -->   Helmer said the parts were timer valves. He said he didn't know
Received from server -->what function the parts served but that they were made only atGeneral Electric's Seattle facility.
Received from server -->   ``We just know they haven't been tested properly,'' Helmer said.</TEXT></DOC>

Received from server -->   A provision slipped into theconstitution approved last year requires Brazilians to vote in 1993
Received from server -->on whether to remain a republic or return to the monarchy overthrowna century ago.
Received from server -->   Who would be king of Latin America's largest and most populousnation is another question, which the constitution says Congress
Received from server -->would decide. Royalists tend to favor a descendant of Pedro II, thelast king, who was deposed by the military in 1889.   Their campaign already is afoot.   ``Monarchy is the cheapest, most modern and most democratic form
Received from server -->of government,'' Rep. Cunha Bueno, author of the constitutionalclause, told about 150 people at the first meeting of theConstitutional Monarchic Movement.
Received from server -->   ``Monarchy defends the people against their own government. The
Received from server -->most advanced nations in the world have it,'' said Bueno, who is 38and a five-term congressman of the rightist Social Democratic Party.
Received from server -->   He named Japan, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Britainand Belgium.
Received from server -->   Applause filled the salon in one of Rio's old, establishmenthotels, a room of chandeliers and crimson drapes with none of the
Received from server -->glitz of tourism.   Most of those attending were elderly; there were men with canes
Received from server -->dressed in the style of plantation days. A few were young, includinga woman in a striped blouse who had a motorcycle helmet tucked under
Received from server -->an arm.   Brazil became independent as a monarchy, the only Latin American
Received from server -->nation to do so. It happened in 1822 when the man who became EmperorPedro I rebelled against his father, King Joao VI of Portugal.
Received from server -->   After the abdication of Pedro I, his son Pedro II reigned fornearly 50 years until military officers overthrew him 100 years agoand proclaimed a republic.
Received from server -->   In an interview, the monarchist Bueno said: ``The so-calledrepublic was actually a military coup shoved down the people's
Received from server -->throats. Now, finally ... the people will be able to say what kindof government they want.''
Received from server -->   His constitutional provision calls for free time on radio andtelevision stations, most of which are privately owned, to get the
Received from server -->message across before the referendum.   The Monarchic Movement points out that relatively few presidents
Received from server -->have served their full terms in Brazil and repressive militarydictatorships ruled in 1930-1945 and 1964-1985.
Received from server -->   Leaders of the movement credit the monarchy with preventing
Received from server -->Brazil from being broken up into small faction-ridden countries,their view of the part of Latin America colonized by Spain.
Received from server -->   On the other side are such as Marcello Alencar, Rio's newlyelected mayor, of the socialist-oriented Democratic Labor Party.
Received from server -->   He told an interviewer: ``Monarchism is a joke. Brazil has notradition or political structure along those lines. Forget it.''
Received from server -->   Comments like that do not faze Bueno. ``We know we are up againsta lot of prejudice,'' he said, ``but once the people understand what
Received from server -->monarchy is, we will win.''   Caio Domingues, head of a large advertising agency working with
Received from server -->the pro-monarchy campaign, said: ``Brazil must rethink its form ofgovernment. The one we have now evidently hasn't worked,''

Received from server -->World. He wore a golden royal crown pin in his lapel.
Received from server -->   Ovidio da Cunha declared at the monarchy meeting: ``Brazil isrotten!'' He observed that federal congressmen have raised their own
Received from server -->pay to the equivalent of about $150,000 a year while the minimum
Received from server -->wage set by the government remains at less than $3 a day.   Da Cunha, 76, is still active as a sociology professor atFluminense Federal University in suburban Rio. He said a king would
Received from server -->be like ``a referee in a soccer game, or like a circuit breaker that
Received from server -->shuts off the electricity before the house catches fire.''   Bueno said most royalists want a descendant of Pedro II as king
Received from server -->of Brazil's 144 million people, who inhabit an area larger than the
Received from server -->48 contiguous United States.   There's a potential hitch in that, however. Two heirs _ the
Received from server -->emperor's great-grandson Pedro Gastao de Orleans e Braganca and LuizOrleans e Braganca, great-grandson of Pedro II's daughter Princess
Received from server -->Isabel, claim to be the true pretender to the throne.
Received from server -->   Pedro Gastao, 75, said he would be willing ``to explain theadvantages of monarchy'' on television. He lives in the formerimperial summer retreat of Petropolis, founded by and named for his
Received from server -->royal ancestor, in the mountains 40 miles north of Rio.   Domingues, the advertising man, said: ``We are not going to get
Received from server -->involved in names. The situation is very complicated. What we'reinterested in is the principle of monarchy.''</TEXT>

Received from server --><TEXT>   In the same year that George Bush and MichaelDukakis criss-crossed the United States searching for votes, Andrew
Received from server -->McCarthy headed for the heartland.
Received from server -->   ``I had never been to America before _ just New York and L.A.,''said the actor, who spent extensive time in the Midwest whilefilming ``Kansas'' and ``Fresh Horses.''
Received from server -->   Neither film was a box-office hit for McCarthy, who has appearedin ``St. Elmo's Fire,'' ``Pretty in Pink'' and ``Mannequin,'' but he
Received from server -->enjoyed the chance to work in new environments.   ``Kansas,'' which also starred Matt Dillon, was filmed in
Received from server -->Lawrence and surrounding areas.   ``We had a ball,'' McCarthy said in a recent interview. ``I found
Received from server -->the people there really neat. We were big fish in a small pond.''
Received from server -->   In ``Fresh Horses,'' filmed in Cincinnati, McCarthy plays a
Received from server -->college student who breaks up with his fiancee after meeting a poorcountry girl (Molly Ringwald).
Received from server -->   ``It was cold,'' he said of the location work. ``There's the
Received from server -->whole starkness up there; it helped the mood of the movie.''   Nothing could have prepared McCarthy, a theater major at New York
Received from server -->University, for the quickness of his entry into the movie business.
Received from server -->Back in 1983, he was just another student at NYU when he decided toanswer an ``open call'' in the newspaper for a part in ``Class,''
Received from server -->which starred Jacqueline Bisset.
Received from server -->   ``I waited for hours with 500 other kids and they called meback,'' McCarthy recalled. ``It was so out of the blue. One week I
Received from server -->was in school and the next week I'm in bed with Jacqueline Bisset. Ithought, `I'm doing something right here.' I was going so fast, I
Received from server -->didn't have time to think about it.''
Received from server -->   Bisset gave him a lot of professional help.   ``She was great, she could have said, `Who is this punk?' and
Received from server -->taken advantage of me. She was amazingly patient and considerate to
Received from server -->me. She and the director would say, `That's the camera, Andrew,'''he recalled.
Received from server -->   McCarthy's first major success came in 1985 with ``St. Elmo's
Received from server -->Fire,'' which also featured Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez,Ally Sheedy and Demi Moore.
Received from server -->   ``St. Elmo's Fire,'' a smash hit despite scathing reviews, was a
Received from server -->mixed blessing for McCarthy. He was unquestionably popular at thebox office, but his image suffered from being grouped with other
Received from server -->young actors whose talents were questionable and who were known as
Received from server -->arrogant and pretentious. ``Brat Packers'' they were called.
Received from server -->   ``I never really tried to take it that seriously,'' McCarthysaid. ``I haven't talked to any of them since I worked with them. If
Received from server -->people want labels, it makes it easier to identify someone. I don't
Received from server -->really care. It doesn't mean anything to me.''   But he was concerned about being cast in parts designed to bring
Received from server -->teen-agers into the theaters.
Received from server -->   ``It's such a trap because they keep sending you the same moviesand then you say I'll do just one more and you're letting them
Received from server -->control your life.''
Received from server -->   So in 1986, McCarthy was happy to have the chance to appear withLinda Hunt and Linda Bassett in the American Playhouse Production of
Received from server -->``Waiting for the Moon,'' based on the lives of Gertrude Stein and
Received from server -->Alice B. Toklas.   ``I was doing `Mannequin' when I got the script and I thought it
Received from server -->was a wonderful little story. I also wanted to work with Linda Hunt.
Received from server -->It was a nice little project,'' he said.   Despite his success, McCarthy is not immune from getting cold
Received from server -->feet _ last- minute doubts about whether he is capable of playing a
Received from server -->particular role. He recalled having those feelings while making``Weekend at Bernie's,'' a comedy to be released later in 1989.
Received from server -->   ``I was torturing myself, saying `I can't do this. I'm not
Received from server -->funny.' My friend said, `You're such a jerk. You were like this whenyou were about to do `Fresh Horses.' You were like this with all of
Received from server -->them.''
Received from server -->   But McCarthy isn't likely to give up this little ritual.   ``I think it's good for you to ask, `What the hell am I doinghere?' They're paying me a lot of money and I don't know what I'mdoing. That's part of the fun in a sick little way.''
Received from server -->   And if his popularity does fade, McCarthy can always count on thesupport of his friends in Middle America.
Received from server -->   ``I got a letter the other day from the Locke family inMinnesota,'' he said. ``They write me letters every month. They have
Received from server -->a birthday cake for me and I'm invited for Thanksgiving.''

Received from server --><BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
Received from server --><DATELINE>GRUENE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>
Received from server -->   Jerry Jeff Walker walked onto the smallstage at Gruene Hall, slung the exotic reptile skin strap of his
Received from server -->Martin guitar over his shoulder and signaled to the band he wasready to start.
Received from server -->   To the resounding applause of 600 people at the rustic,wood-floor honky-tonk, he picked and crooned one country tune after
Received from server -->another, talking to the crowd in between instrumental solos as if hewere talking to old friends.
Received from server -->   At the chorus of one tune, the 46-year-old Walker reminded his
Received from server -->audience he had matured just a bit: He was once regarded as a harddrinking, cussing rebel both on and off the stage who couldn't careless for the business end of his career.   ``We're just here to play a little music, not watch me throw up.... I've already done that ... before,'' he said to ear-piercing
Received from server -->hoots and hollers in the 110-year-old dance hall where burlap sacks
Received from server -->hung from the rafters and newspaper ads adorned the walls.   The recent performance was another success. It also was aninspiration for Walker, who recorded his first album in three years
Received from server -->and his first live one in 10 years at the hall.
Received from server -->   ``I've been playing here for years and we've had fun here,''Walker said in an interview. ``I usually record live anyway in thestudio and I got some songs that I wanted some people to sing along
Received from server -->on and I wanted to get the audience to join in.   ``We're living in a very high-tech era with mechanical drums and
Received from server -->other things. I thought it would be fun to make a live album withjust regular ol' musicians playing music.''
Received from server -->   During his two decades in the music business, Walker has playedto thousands at concert halls and to a few fans and friends at dimly
Received from server -->lighted bars in the middle of nowhere.   Gruene _ pronounced Green _ is about a third of the way to
Received from server -->Austin, where Walker lives with his wife and two children.   Walker, who recorded the live ``Viva Terlingua'' album in the
Received from server -->once-unknown Hill Country hamlet of Luckenbach, believes Gruene'ssmall-town flavor was just right for him and his fans for the new
Received from server -->album.   ``It's more of a treat for people to come here. They can put on
Received from server -->their Levi's, come out in their pickup truck, bring along some beerand come out and be heard,'' he said.
Received from server -->   The Oneonta, N.Y., native wrote such songs as ``Drifting Way of
Received from server -->Life,'' ``Gypsy Songman,'' ``Hill Country Rain'' and ``CadillacCowboy.''   But he is best known for ``Mr. Bojangles,'' a song about a
Received from server -->raggedy old man who danced a soft shoe for money. Walker wrote the
Received from server -->tune during his wild days in 1968 but it remains popular and hasbeen recorded by such artists as Nina Simone.
Received from server -->   ``I still think it's part of everything,'' Walker said. ``I thinkpeople in show business have identified with that song and that'swhat's kept it around.''   Time and a family have changed Walker some, but the rebel is
Received from server -->still within him. He has shed his reputation as a boozer who playeddrunk at recordings and concerts. He has an occasional beer or two,
Received from server -->but he spends most of his time writing songs, jogging and playinggolf.
Received from server -->   Gone, too, from Walker's life are the entourages that followedhim around the country. He's a solo act now, but in Austin he knows
Received from server -->he easily can get together a few musicians to play anytime he wants,as was the case with the live album. But the independent soul within
Received from server -->him refuses to let others dictate how he should write, play ormarket his music.
Received from server -->   He's using his own money for the album and it will be released onhis Tried and True label. Susan Walker, 40, his wife of 14 years who
Received from server -->also serves as his business manager and president of an official fanclub, is working out a distribution deal.
Received from server -->   ``I think I've shown other song writers or singers that it's OK
Received from server -->to be a little bit out of what the mainstream is at the time,''Walker said.   ``I'm just a happy-go-lucky-kind of a guy that just traveled with
Received from server -->a guitar, played music and never did mind sleeping in the rain,'' he
Received from server -->said, adding that given another chance, he would do it all the same.   ``I'm a character who lives in the song. I can write about my
Received from server -->life. I can get to sing my memories every night and that's prettyfortunate. I'm pretty happy with my life. I played the music I
Received from server -->wanted to play and the people that liked it, liked it, and those whodidn't, well, they're probably better off anyway.''
Received from server -->   Though Walker's attitude about fans has at times been perceivedas flippant, he and his wife insist he does care.
Received from server -->   ``I think it's great the fans stayed there and I think my wife,Susan, getting involved in the business end of my thing has really
Received from server -->helped my fans and me keep in touch with ourselves,'' he said.   Among those fans is Chris Wall, a 38-year-old Wilsall, Mont.,
Received from server -->singer-songwriter who relocated to Austin to open up shows forWalker and to be managed by Susan Walker.
Received from server -->   Walker planned to record at least two of Wall's songs on the new
Received from server -->album, including ``Trashy Women,'' and ``I Feel Like Hanks WilliamsTonight.''
Received from server -->   ``I liked Jerry Jeff because of the caliber of songs he wassinging back in the mid-'70s,'' Wall said. ``He was that rebel,
Received from server -->outlaw kind of guy and I think that's what I really liked about him.   ``He's not what I expected now. He's pretty mellow and we're
Received from server -->pretty good friends. I wonder what he would have been like back thenand I wonder if I would have even been around with him back then.''
Received from server -->   Wall, who hopes Walker can popularize his songs, believes Walkerwill be able to revitalize himself with the new album.
Received from server -->   ``This is important to the fans and they all want to be part ofhistory, just like `Viva Terlingua' in Luckenbach,'' Wall said.
Received from server -->``Not that he needs it or maybe not even want it, but this willprobably put Jerry back where he belongs.''
Received from server -->   For Wall and other struggling artists, Gruene has become a place
Received from server -->for debuts. After Walker's recording, the small community _ with abed-and-breakfast, a couple of restaurants and several antique shops
Received from server -->_ may be bustling like Luckenbach did after Walker, Willie Nelson,Waylon Jennings and others popularized it in music.

Received from server --><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
Received from server --><TEXT>   Iraq is rehabilitating its brief monarchy,
Received from server -->the reviled ``regime of henchmen'' that was begun by the British in1921 and ended with the murder of the third king in 1958.
Received from server -->   The change of heart became evident after a cease-fire wasdeclared Aug. 20 in the 8-year-old war with Iran. It has been
Received from server -->accompanied by the first moves toward political liberalization afterdecades of iron control.
Received from server -->   Books and articles have appeared reviewing and reassessing themonarchy created when the Ottoman Empire was carved up after World
Received from server -->War I and Iraq was created from the provinces of Baghdad, Basra andMosul.
Received from server -->   Faisal I, third son of Sherif Hussein of Mecca who had lost hisHashemite kingdom in Syria, was crowned Aug. 23, 1921. The
Received from server -->coronation was arranged by the British, who had occupied what wasthen called Mesopotamia since the war.
Received from server -->   Ghazi I and Faisal II, the son and grandson of the first king,
Received from server -->succeeded him. Faisal II was killed in the coup of 1958.   After 30 years of neglect, the Religious Endowment Ministry has
Received from server -->allocated the equivalent of $3 million to refurbish the royalcemetery, where the kings and some family members are buried.
Received from server -->   King Hussein of Jordan, a cousin of Faisal II and an importantally of President Saddam Hussein in the war with Iran, appears to
Received from server -->have been the main influence for rehabilitation.   When the Jordanian monarch visited Baghdad recently, President
Received from server -->Hussein accompanied him on a visit to the cemetery.   The ruling Baath Socialist Party attached the ``regime of
Received from server -->henchmen'' label long ago and no one dared defy its version ofhistory. Now, suddenly, the party allows the same kings to be
Received from server -->portrayed as great nationalists, leaders in the quest for Arab unity.   ``I'm 100 percent sure that they did not betray their country. .
Received from server -->.. There were only differences of opinion,'' Abdullah Bakr, the last
Received from server -->chief of the royal court, wrote in a magazine article that wouldhave been impossible before.
Received from server -->   Last month, Saddam Hussein announced a program of politicalreform that includes allowing opposition political parties, amnesty
Received from server -->for political prisoners, improvements in human rights andencouraging private enterprise.
Received from server -->   Western and Arab diplomats question how far he will go towardreform, but the flood of publications about the monarch emphasizes a
Received from server -->notable decline in censorship.   The books and articles have spurred debate on whether the time
Received from server -->has come for a reappraisal of Iraq's entire turbulent history _ atale of kings, tribal warfare, coups, assassination, Kurdish
Received from server -->rebellion and war encompassed by less than seven decades.   ``We weren't afraid of them when they were alive, so why should
Received from server -->we fear them when they're dead?'' an Iraqi official said in aninterview, speaking of the discredited kings.
Received from server -->   Fadhil Hussein, a University of Indiana graduate who teaches in
Received from server -->the Baghdad University history department, said it may be too soonto reassess the monarchy.
Received from server -->   ``You can't prevent historical truth from being marked bypolitical and social loyalties,'' he told an interviewer. ``History
Received from server -->cannot be written when our recent past still has a great impact onour present.''
Received from server -->   Nonetheless, books on the subject have sold thousands of copies
Received from server -->and new editions are being printed. Many have been serialized innewspapers.
Received from server -->   Historians and other academics have differed about the role ofthe monarchy in shaping modern Iraq.   Britain had sought to create a coherent political entity and the
Received from server -->monarchy was a unifying element for a time, but Iraq soon was tornby tribal rebellion, massacres and political intrigue.
Received from server -->   Iraqis generally have resented the monarchy as the creation ofthe British, but many politicians now see the kings as realists whobelieved the nation's integrity and development depended on British
Received from server -->protection from external threat.   Whether they tell the whole truth or not, the publications have
Received from server -->succeeded in bringing history to the attention of younger Iraqis.   ``There's a huge gap in the new generation's thinking about the
Received from server -->monarchy,'' said Ahmed Fawzi, who has written a dozen books abouthis country's short life.
Received from server -->   He described his writings on the monarchy as a ``dignified
Received from server -->revival of history'' for people who are not familiar with the periodand have not received an ``objective account'' from official
Received from server -->teachings in government schools.   ``The idea is to record the events of this period'' so other
Received from server -->versions ``cannot be easily fabricated,'' he said.

Received from server --><BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
Received from server --><TEXT>   Always and ever there are things to worry aboutregarding the economy's future, and no forecaster seeking to remain
Received from server -->employed would dare not mention them.   To them, the issuance of warnings is professional protection,
Received from server -->allowing a forecast to be made but escaped from if wrong. Nothing islost, since most warnings are considered examples of erudition andresponsibility.
Received from server -->   You should, know, however, that most of last year's warnings _inflation, dollar collapse, stock market debacle, recession _ were
Received from server -->changed in midstream, only to be trotted out again as the New Yearbegan.
Received from server -->   This is the 1989 list, with comments by Edward Yardeni, thePrudential_Bache Securities economist who debunked last year's
Received from server -->forecasting myths and stands firm and independent from the generalconsensus this year.   _The Economy Is Overdue For A Recession.
Received from server -->   The expansion has lasted more than six years, a long time by past
Received from server -->measures, suggesting that the odds can't be bucked much longer. But,hold on; the economic world has changed, and maybe the past isn'tthat accurate a criterion.
Received from server -->   True, there has been no general recession in that time period,but there have been several rolling recessions. Different industries
Received from server -->at different times have been very hard hit, but the impact wasoffset by good times in others.
Received from server -->   But what if these different industries slump at the same time? Itcould happen, but many U.S. companies now operate globally, and bad
Received from server -->times in the United States could be offset by good business inEurope.
Received from server -->   _Capacity Is Too Tight.   The percentage of production capacity rose above 84 percent in
Received from server -->November, marking the highest level in eight years. Federal ReserveChairman Alan Greenspan, among many, is concerned that such a levelmay generate inflation.
Received from server -->   ``This could be a big mistake,'' says Yardeni. Why? Because ``inan environment of intense global competition, we believe that tightcapacity stimulates expansion rather than big price increases.''
Received from server -->   _The Jobless Rate Is Too Low, So Wage Inflation Will Develop.   At 5.3 percent of the civilian labor force, the rate is at a14-year low. There is indeed a shortage of new entrants into the
Received from server -->labor force. The thesis appear sound.   Still, says Yardeni, ``we believe that the employers recognizethat offering big wage hikes will only drive up their labor costs
Received from server -->rather than attract workers that, demographically speaking, don'texist.''
Received from server -->   In his opinion, ``odds are that industries will opt to spend more
Received from server -->on labor-saving, productivity to substitute for scarce and expensiveworkers.''   _The Federal Deficit Is Too Large.
Received from server -->   Sure it is large, and that doesn't include perhaps $75 billion torescue the thrift industry or maybe $150 billion to clean upradioactive pollution at the government's weapons plants.
Received from server -->   But there's a brighter side too. The deficit came down from anannualized peak of $234.4 billion in the second quarter of 1986 to
Received from server -->$124.8 billion in the third quarter of 1988. Include state and localsurpluses and the total government deficit dropped from $174.3billion to $68.9 billion in this period.   The big ``problem,'' says Yardeni, is in transfer payments,
Received from server -->designed to redistribute income more equitably, which amounted to23.2 percent of gross national product in fiscal 1988, a very large
Received from server -->fraction.   But in terms of expenses for goods and services, the situationwasn't all that bad. In the third quarter of last year purchases of
Received from server -->goods and services were but 8.1 percent of GNP, compared with more
Received from server -->than 10 percent in the 1960s.   _The Trade Deficit Isn't Narrowing Fast Enough.
Received from server -->   Really? Says Yardeni: ``The adjustment process is still workingin our view and it will take another two years to produce a zero
Received from server -->trade balance.'' Imports have clearly stopped growing. Exports arewell above previous-year figures.</TEXT>

Received from server --><DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
Received from server --><TEXT>   Public debate about whether they
Received from server -->should work on Sunday is making it hard for citizens of Europe'srichest country to enjoy the sabbath quiet the Bible extols and
Received from server -->their constitution protects.
Received from server -->   Most West Germans hew to the tradition of a day on which thefamily has coffee and cake at home and the children often are even
Received from server -->discouraged from going next door to play with friends.
Received from server -->   Popular magazines and newspapers carry contributions from
Received from server -->prominent people singing the virtues of Sunday in church and at home.   The constitution provides special protection for Sundays as days
Received from server -->``of rest from work and of spiritual uplift,'' but union leaders say
Received from server -->2.2 million in this nation of nearly 62 million people work at leastone Sunday a month.
Received from server -->   Hermann Rappe, head of the 630,000-member chemical workers union,issued the latest call for more Sunday work. Other union leadersunited against him in what one called an ``avalanche'' of opposition.
Received from server -->   Rappe was quoted as saying in an interview with the newspaperOsnabruecker Zeitung: ``The unions must be ready to negotiate over
Received from server -->Sunday work for reasons of economics.
Received from server -->   ``I'd prefer to have businesses use their money to create jobs inthe Federal Republic (West Germany) rather than in Spain or Greece.
Received from server -->If that's only possible with more work on weekends, the unions can'tsimply say no.''
Received from server -->   Business representatives praised him. Klaus Murmann, head of thenational management council, called Rappe's comments a ``beneficial
Received from server -->shot of realism.''   Leaders of the printers, public workers, office workers, themighty, 2.5-million-member steel workers union and some others
Received from server -->didn't find his viewpoint beneficial in the least.   ``Hermann Rappe's position was not and is not that of theprinters union,'' spokeswoman Ulla Krause-Schaeuffler told The
Received from server -->Associated Press. ``He has set off an avalanche. We are currently innegotiations to block Sunday work.''   Rainer Hillgaertner, spokesman for the public workers, said his
Received from server -->union wants to keep Sunday work to a minimum because ``the culturalvalue of having Sunday off ranks above the principle of maximizing
Received from server -->profits.''
Received from server -->   Ernst Breit, head of the DGB labor federation, which has 7.7million members, also has expressed public opposition to work on
Received from server -->Sunday.
Received from server -->   Church leaders, worried about a drop in attendance, have beensteadfast in disapproval.   ``We stand by our previous positions,'' Lutheran church spokesman
Received from server -->Peter Kollmar told the AP, citing the importance ``of the observance
Received from server -->of the Lord's Day and the cultural role of Sunday.''
Received from server -->   The issue even united Roman Catholic and Lutheran prelates in
Received from server -->1984 long enough to issue a joint statement denouncing furtherexpansion of Sunday work.   ``The Bible teaches us: `God blessed the seventh day and made it
Received from server -->holy, because on that day he ceased from all the work he had sethimself to do,'' the statement said in a citation from Genesis.   ``Remember to keep the sabbath day holy,'' the Christian leaders
Received from server -->added, quoting from Exodus.</TEXT>

Received from server --><TEXT>   The long Palestinian uprising has brought
Received from server -->bitterness to Israeli humor, and the comedian's opener was not meantto put his audience at ease.
Received from server -->   ``Soldiers in uniform get in with a discount,'' Yonathan Geffensaid, and after a pause: ``Soldiers with clubs get in free.''   He referred to beatings by soldiers of protesters in the occupied
Received from server -->West Bank and Gaza Strip, where more than 300 Palestinians have beenkilled and thousands wounded. Such a joke would have been
Received from server -->unthinkable before the rebellion began Dec. 8, 1987.   In night clubs, theaters and galleries, artists of various kinds
Received from server -->grapple with questions about the violence of occupation and thebrutalizing effect on Israeli society of the army's handling of the
Received from server -->uprising.   A satire by nightclub performer Dudu Topaz takes the form of anarmy radio report of an incident said to have begun when a young
Received from server -->Palestinian urinated on a soldier's leg.   The army arrests his entire family and destroys their house, andan officer declares on the radio: ``The youth was known as apotential terrorist.''
Received from server -->   A reporter finds the perpetrator, but discovers he is not yet oldenough to talk.
Received from server -->   Performing artists have collided with those who control state-run
Received from server -->radio and television. Topaz was barred from a radio talk show for
Received from server -->two weeks for comments critical of the army.   Israel television rejected a skit by comedian Tuvia Tzafir that
Received from server -->attacked public apathy by depicting an Israeli family watching TVwhile a fire raged outside.
Received from server -->   Lyrics in ``Coexistence With Love,'' a new album by vocalist
Received from server -->Astar Shamir, accuse the government of failing to explore optionsfor peace while young soldiers do the dirty work of occupation.
Received from server -->   As one of her songs, ``A Moment Before the Storm,'' puts it: ``Mybrother isn't a cruel soldier, but he's cold in his soul. He stands
Received from server -->there with his hand on the trigger, but he hates the war. ... Don'tsend my brother to the trigger.''
Received from server -->   Ms. Shamir said in an interview: ``When I sat opposite thetelevision last January, and they started showing me what was
Received from server -->happening, I couldn't sleep nights. I know songs don't change thingsand can't move armies, but ... they just came pouring out.''
Received from server -->   Early last year, army radio banned pop singer Si Hyman's song``Shooting and Crying'' about soldiers who used a bulldozer to bury
Received from server -->four young Palestinians alive in a West Bank village. The victimssurvived, and the soldiers were given jail terms of up to a year.   ``Have we forgotten our children were killed, too?'' Hyman asks
Received from server -->in the chorus, alluding to the Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews.   In a Jaffa nightclub, Tzafir performs a skit accusing Prime
Received from server -->Minister Yitzhak Shamir of ignoring opportunities for peace.   It depicts Shamir visiting an eye doctor and refusing to read a
Received from server -->wall chart that says, ``There are Palestinians,'' and in smaller
Received from server -->letters, ``There is a chance for peace.''   ``My vision is too good,'' Shamir says. ``I need something toblock all this out.''
Received from server -->   Palestinians have incorporated themes of the uprising into songs
Received from server -->and plays. Words of a protest song reflect the tendency toward
Received from server -->rhetoric: ``With the Molotov (gasoline bomb), with the stones, Imake my revolution. ... With the stones, we get rid of the enemy.''
Received from server -->   An art exhibit at the Hakawati Theatre in Arab east Jerusalem wasa series of portraits of Palestinians killed in the rebellion. Thenew play ``Waiting for the Savior'' depicts buffoon-like Israeli
Received from server -->soldiers harassing Palestinians going about their daily lives.
Received from server -->   ``Everything is political,'' said Jamal Ghosheh, director of the
Received from server -->theatre. ``We are talking about our lives. Our lives are political.''
Received from server -->   For Israeli performers, who do active and reserve army duty likeeveryone else, it is more complicated.
Received from server -->   At one point in his show, Topaz stopped and said, ``I wonder if Ihave the right to do this. I'm laughing at everyone, but I'mlaughing at myself as well, because I, too, am a soldier.''
Received from server -->   The comedian, whose father came here from the Soviet Union, saidin an interview: ``This is not the country I wanted. It's not thekind of behavior I want. If someone had told my father he was coming
Received from server -->to live in a country that would rule another nation, he never wouldhave come.''</TEXT>

Received from server -->that has grown by leaps and bounds in the United States. This is thefirst of three articles.</TEXT>

Received from server -->   In a fit of depression, when her thirdbout with cancer had sounded a death knell, Julia Gebersky inquired
Received from server -->through others whether her son, Robert, had a gun and could shoot.   Incontinent, her body scarred by bedsores, she had become a
Received from server -->prisoner of her own helplessness. If euthanasia were legal, Bob Gery
Received from server -->said, he would have helped his mother kill herself.   But there was another way out for Julie Gebersky. Like nearly200,000 patients a year, she awaited her death in hospice, a way
Received from server -->station for the terminally ill that benignly treats them not forprolongation of life but to ease their dying and lessen their pain.
Received from server -->   Gery's mother died without much discomfort in the gentle hands ofThe Connecticut Hospice, just as his father had died of cancer
Received from server -->nearly 13 years ago under the same hospice care.
Received from server -->   In that span, the number of hospice care programs in the UnitedStates has grown from fewer than 100 to nearly 1,700, according to a
Received from server -->1988 survey by the National Hospice Organization in Arlington, Va.,which provides technical services for its 900 members.
Received from server -->   While care is much the same, and about 90 percent of it isprovided in the home, the programs are operated by a variety oforganizations. For example, 41.8 percent of the programs are
Received from server -->independently run, 26.6 percent are run by hospitals, 22.4 percentby agencies that provide care in the home, and 9.2 percent are run
Received from server -->by a coalition of organizations such as nursing homes and hospitalsworking together.
Received from server -->   ``Hospice is not a place, it's a program of care,'' says IraBates, vice president of the National Hospice Organization. ``We are
Received from server -->the only health care provider that defines the unit of care as boththe patient and the family.''
Received from server -->   Hospice does this by sending in a team, including volunteers andsocial workers, to help the family with housework and personal
Received from server -->problems, to maintain the vigil while they take a break and to helpwith funeral arrangements once the patient dies. After that, hospice
Received from server -->workers keep in touch with the family for at least a year to comfortthem.
Received from server -->   Many hospice programs are based in office buildings and lease
Received from server -->beds from hospitals and nursing homes. ``If there is a crisis in the
Received from server -->family, then we can provide continuous home care in the homearound-the-clock,'' Bates says. ``If that's not enough, then we canmove the patient to an inpatient setting.''
Received from server -->   The modern hospice system originated in England in 1967, whenCicely Saunders, a British physician, founded St. Christopher's
Received from server -->Hospice.   What brought it about, say hospice authorities, was the leap in
Received from server -->technical advances in medicine since the mid-1950s and theincreasingly common dilemma of terminally ill patients being kept
Received from server -->alive, sometimes against their wishes and the wishes of theirfamilies, at high costs in suffering and financial sacrifice.
Received from server -->   Even some of those dealt the cruelest of hands in life, AIDSvictims who are not only dying but are homeless, find refuge in some
Received from server -->hospices like The Connecticut Hopsice, the first and oldest in the
Received from server -->United States and a leader in care for the terminally ill in thepast two decades.   Connecticut Hospice began caring for the dying in their homes in
Received from server -->March 1974 and opened a 44-bed hospice for inpatients in July 1980in Branford. Two years ago, it bought an adjoining home and
Received from server -->converted it into a cottage with five beds for the dying who have no
Received from server -->home or no one to care for them.
Received from server -->   Bates says Connecticut Hospice is unique in its much higherproportion of inpatient care to home care. It serves as a teachinghospice as well.
Received from server -->   The average hospice, says Bates, has three or four beds, a paidstaff of eight and 50 volunteers, dealing with about 110 patients a
Received from server -->year. The discharge rate is around 10 percent, those who decide toseek treatment or who go into remission.
Received from server -->   While hospice patients are mostly elderly cancer victims, as muchas 90 percent, the '80s have brought a new challenge, a younger
Received from server -->generation afflicted with AIDS, either cast aside by society or inself-imposed exile to keep loved ones from seeing them at theirworst.   The latest data available from the National Hospice Organization
Received from server -->show hospices served about 2,100 AIDS victims in 1986, among 154,700patients in all. While later figures are not available, Bates
Received from server -->estimates the number of AIDS victims cared for will reach 6,000 or
Received from server -->7,000.   Among them are men like Keith Jackson, 27, and Eddie Muniz, 36,
Received from server -->who found accommodations in The Connecticut Hospice cottage last
Received from server -->year, their gaunt bodies implanted with catheters, their shoulders
Received from server -->propped up by hospice volunteers and friends so they could walk,
Received from server -->their lips barely movable, slurring their speech almost as if they'dsuffered a stroke, and coughing, coughing, coughing.   ``I got a home but I don't want to be near the girls because I've
Received from server -->been sick,'' Muniz, an admitted drug dealer and user and the fatherof three daughters, ages 8, 10 and 12, told a visitor last November.
Received from server -->``I know I'm gone. I don't want to go...'' He paused. ``Yet.''
Received from server -->   Jackson, a fashion model who is gay, lived with his divorced
Received from server -->mother until she died two years ago. He said he would rather live in
Received from server -->the cottage than move in with his father or siblings. ``This is myhome,'' he said.   Nurses, the heart of hospice care, and volunteers, the soul, givethe men medication, feed them, do their laundry and take them out todinner and to shop. Like many of the terminally ill, they dread
Received from server -->above all dying alone, in confusion and fear. The hospices quietlyease those apprehensions.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>

Received from server --><HEAD>For release Sun., Jan. 22</HEAD><HEAD>BRANFORD, Conn.: those apprehensions.</HEAD><TEXT>   For ``sundowners,'' who fear the night and sleep by day, familiesare often bedded down by their bedsides in inpatient hospices like
Received from server -->The Connecticut Hospice, which has its own building. Other hospicesoperate in a wing or ward of hospitals.   ``One of the big complaints is that dying is so sterile,'' says
Received from server -->Pat Jones, executive vice president of the Hospice Association ofAmerica, a Washington lobby group that represents 1,300 hospices.
Received from server -->``People were isolated in a hospital room, maybe the family couldn'tcome in. I think it's related to the need to be in control of one's
Received from server -->life. I don't think it's an accident that hospice started cominginto being around the same time as home birth. It's taking dying
Received from server -->back into the family, into the home.''   Indeed, says National Hospice's Bates. ``Most people want to die
Received from server -->at home. Ninety-eight percent will say, `I want to be at home withmy wife and family.' So we make that possible.''
Received from server -->   All of health care, Bates says, is moving toward more choices,the kind of choices made by Julia Gebersky and by Mark Marcucci, a
Received from server -->57-year-old retired steelworker from Bethel Park, Pa.   Like others with incurable cancer, they decided they had had
Received from server -->enough of hospitals and doctors and that there was little elsecaretakers could do but keep them comfortable.
Received from server -->   Mrs. Gebersky died as she wanted, surrounded by people she loved,her body free of the dreaded tubes. She had been cared for at her
Received from server -->apartment in neighboring Hamden by a Connecticut Hospice nurse, wholooked in on her twice a week, an outside nurse and a privately
Received from server -->hired, live-in aide who took care of her around-the-clock.   Mrs. Gebersky fought a cancer in the parotid gland, near the ear,
Received from server -->through surgery and radiation for seven years. Her condition
Received from server -->worsened last fall and at her age, 76, she decided against furthertreatment with chemotherapy.   Her apartment had been decorated for a last Thanksgiving dinner
Received from server -->with her family, and there was a Christmas tree in case there would
Received from server -->be time for that, but two days before the holiday she slipped into a
Received from server -->coma and was moved to The Connecticut Hospice at Branford, where shedied on Thanksgiving Day.   One of her last wishes was to give the artificial Christmas treeto the hospice, and Bob Gery, one of her sons, did that.
Received from server -->   Gery's father, Benjamin, 64, died at home of cancer on May 11,1976, four years before the inpatient hospice was built.   After his father died, Gery (who shortened his name) served on
Received from server -->the board of Connecticut Hospice for five years, helping raise fundsfor the non-profit organization.
Received from server -->   ``You always know where the good service is for this type ofcare,'' Gery says. ``The most important thing was that Connecticut
Received from server -->Hospice would respect her wish to die with dignity. That's basicallywhere hospice distinguished itself from hospitals.''
Received from server -->   Mark Marcucci called it quits after a four-year struggle with
Received from server -->colon cancer. He had been in and out of hospitals, had undergone a
Received from server -->colostomy, catheterization, intravenous morphine to palliate thepain, had shrunk from 215 pounds to 140 pounds, had begun tohallucinate.   When his wife of 26 years, Pat, could no longer care for him athome, he was admitted last summer to the Forbes Hospice in
Received from server -->Pittsburgh, one of the divisions of the Forbes Health System thatincludes hospitals and a gerontology center.   He stayed at the hospice five days, then came home to die withhis wife and two sons at his side. Death came on Aug. 9, as ``we
Received from server -->kept him comfortable, propped up, and just sat there with him,'' Patsays. ``It's not that they didn't treat him well at the hospice. Ijust think he wanted to be with us.''   Generally, hospice care is for those who have been diagnosed by a
Received from server -->physician as having six months or less to live. Their average stay
Received from server -->in the program is 45 days.   In surroundings familiar to them, home-care patients are visitedby a team of hospice workers including nurses, homemakers, socialworkers.
Received from server -->   Coincidentally, says Bates, ``any strategy that keeps people outof hospitals saves loads of money.'' He estimates savings of 20percent to 40 percent for taxpayers who foot the Medicare bill for
Received from server -->patients 65 and over and for health insurance companies, many of
Received from server -->which now provide hospice benefits.
Received from server -->   Beyond that, says Bates, most hospices are committed to careregardless of the patient's ability to pay. Since reimbursementsrarely cover expenses, most hospices rely on grants and donations tomeet their budgets. Ninety-five percent of them are non-profit,
Received from server -->Bates says.   ``Ninety percent of our patients die at home,'' says Patricia
Received from server -->O'Neil, a liaison nurse at the Merrimack Valley Hospice in Andover,
Received from server -->Mass. ``I think that's really important because in order for that tohappen you need a lot of support and intensive visits.''
Received from server -->   Hospice patients range from the very young to the very old. At
Received from server -->Merrimack Valley Hospice, many are in the program only a few days,
Received from server -->because people are naturally reluctant to make the provision, since
Received from server -->it means ``a real acknowledgment that you're finished with lookingfor a cure,'' says Mrs. O'Neil.
Received from server -->   ``We can be very low-key,'' she says, ``but there has to be someunderstanding, at least from someone in the family, that theprognosis is limited.''
Received from server -->   Patients, she says, are not necessarily afraid of death itself,
Received from server -->but of the process of dying. A hospice program can comfort themabout that.</TEXT>

Received from server --><TEXT>   Mike and Harry Dutchburn shared a life as
Received from server -->predictable as January's blizzards and July's blackberries.   Awake by 4 and asleep by 9. Off to the barn at 4, 2 and 5.Errands once a week: St. Albans for parts, Newport for fertilizer,
Received from server -->John Deuso's store at the crossroads for potatoes, hot dogs and
Received from server -->bread.   In a weather-beaten farmhouse on a lonely stretch of highway 10
Received from server -->miles from Canada, the brothers passed their evenings in unmatched
Received from server -->armchairs in a kitchen papered with sailing ships and maps of theworld.   The wallpaper was hung by a sister years ago. Mike, 77, andHarry, 79, likely would have chosen pictures of cows over maps of a
Received from server -->world they've had precious little to do with, until it burst in onthem one January night.   Anyone in town can point out the Dutchburn place, with itsblistered white paint and drawn shades. Surrounded by open fields,house and barn sit near the road on a curve that's unexpectedly
Received from server -->tricky. Mike and Harry have lost track of the cars they've pulledfrom the mud over the years, a habit of helpfulness that was to costthem.   From their kitchen window, they can see their hillside
Received from server -->birthplace, the only other home they've ever known. They stillremember moving day, June 15, 1915, just as they do every journeyaway from home ever since: their brother's funeral in Massachusetts
Received from server -->in 1944; Mike's trip to their sister's in Michigan in 1960; the
Received from server -->65-mile drive with their niece, Sandra Lyon, to Burlington a yearand a half ago. Harry hadn't been there for 40 years.   Except for pies and cookies from Grandma's Bakery in Richford,the Dutchburns' list of indulgences is shorter than the list oftheir trips: an aborted attempt at cigar-smoking in 1940 (Harry),
Received from server -->and two chug-a-lugged bottles of gin in 1939 (Mike).   ``We don't owe anybody,'' says Mike. ``We pay cash or we do
Received from server -->without. We go right along. That's our way.''   The Dutchburns' ways _ modesty, hard work and thrift _ were
Received from server -->common knowledge on the frugal little farms of Franklin County. Sowas their habit of carrying large sums of cash.   On the last day of January 1986, the ways of the world _violence, cruelty and greed _ were brought home to the Dutchburns by
Received from server -->two strangers who called them by name.   They pretended to be out of gas. The Dutchburns didn't have any,
Received from server -->but Mike climbed out of his narrow iron bed in the middle of the
Received from server -->night. By the time he'd walked the few steps to the kitchen, the twomen had kicked in the door.   ``You shouldn't be here,'' Mike told them. He got hit in the face.
Received from server -->   Harry, who had $7,000 in his shirt pocket, walked in right behindhim and got hit in the head with the thick maple cane he used toprod cows.   Mike put up a fight, but it was over in less than five minutes.Afterward, Mike says, ``the kitchen looked like you'd cut a bunch ofhens' heads off and let 'em fly.''
Received from server -->   Five minutes was all it took to teach two old men about fear. Thefear never left them, not even after the robbers went to jail.
Received from server -->   ``I don't sleep anymore. I hear the cars all night. You don't
Received from server -->forget it,'' says Mike. He only has to look at his brother to
Received from server -->remember. Harry's right eye hangs like a crooked picture in his
Received from server -->face. It swells and weeps in the cold; since the beating, he nolonger goes out to do chores.
Received from server -->   The cane hanging on its peg is another reminder. So are the dentsit left in the old Kelvinator in the kitchen. ``They could havetaken the money,'' Mike says. ``There's no sense beating a personup.''   He rubs the dents gently. ``It's the people in the world that's
Received from server -->changed,'' he says. ``They don't care who they take from.''   Detective Sgt. Bill Northrup, an 18-year veteran of the VermontState Police, calls it ``as brutal as any homicide I've everinvestigated.''
Received from server -->   Except that it wasn't a homicide. The Dutchburns survived.   They just didn't recover.   Mike Dutchburn lay for 3{ hours on the kitchen floor after thebeating, afraid to move. Harry was unconscious. When Mike saw alight go on next door at dawn, he crawled out to his Chevy pickupand drove half a mile to the neighbor's.
Received from server -->   When their niece got word at 5:30 that morning, she drovestraight to Montgomery. At the farmhouse where she'd spent childhoodvacations petting calves and eating ice cream, Sandy Lyon found twostate police troopers in a kitchen spattered with blood. In her
Received from server -->uncles' hospital room, she says, ``I didn't recognize either one ofthem.''   Lyon, a bank teller with three grown children, has the manners of
Received from server -->a Sunday school teacher _ until she talks about the beating. Then
Received from server -->she starts saying ``hell'' a lot.

Received from server -->   ``They were easygoing. They took you for who you were. Mikepulled my pigtails. Harry was the perfect image of my dad, who died
Received from server -->when I was 17.''   Since the beating, she says, ``Harry has been to the barn once.
Received from server -->Mostly, he sits there and broods. They're withdrawn now. They havethat constant fear. Any little noise on the porch and they'repetrified.''
Received from server -->   Harry lets Mike take him to the barber, but outings are rare. Hehas trouble climbing into the truck; his back, like his brother's,is bent from years of work in the low-ceilinged barn.   The money Harry carried in and out of that barn, the money ripped
Received from server -->out of his pocket, helped lead police to the attackers.
Received from server -->   ``You spend 20 hours a day in a barn,'' Northrup says, ``and your
Received from server -->money will smell like a barn.''   Salesmen at Champlain Chevrolet in Enosberg knew that smell. It
Received from server -->had lingered long after Mike Dutchburn drove off in his new pickuptruck. They finally tracked it to the cash in the safe.   Northrup alerted all Vermont banks and stores to be on the
Received from server -->lookout for hundred-dollar bills with ``a strong barn odor.'' Thatled to some of the Dutchburns' money. The money led to one of themen.
Received from server -->   Judge Frank Mahady can still picture the two stooped figures infaded green work clothes who shuffled into his Burlington courtroomas if from another century to talk sorrowfully about locking doors
Received from server -->and mistrusting strangers.   Harry told of no longer being able to work. ``The best part of mylife is gone now,'' he said.   Mahady listened patiently as the Dutchburns and their niece tried
Received from server -->to explain why two years and eight months in jail _ the terms of a
Received from server -->proposed plea agreement _ didn't feel much like justice.   ``There is a very fundamental right, the right to be simply left
Received from server -->alone,'' the judge said finally. ``It is so important and so basic
Received from server -->it doesn't have to be set forth in any documents. That basic,
Received from server -->fundamental right was taken away. That's unpardonable.''   Mahady isn't known for rejecting plea bargains. ``To the hard
Received from server -->right,'' he says wryly, ``I'm known as `the criminal's judge.'''   He made an exception in the case of Darrell Clark, 39 and
Received from server -->unemployed, with a record of larceny and assault. In July 1987,
Received from server -->Mahady gave Clark five to 10 years in jail. Another judge gave LouisGilbeau, 33, a stainer at a furniture factory, eight to 10 years,with all but five suspended.   Both men can expect to serve three years and nine months. ``A
Received from server -->rope around the neck would've been better,'' says Harry.   He and Mike spent three days in the hospital after the beating,
Received from server -->then signed themselves out. The doctors wanted to keep them longer.
Received from server -->The Dutchburns had had enough doctoring.   They opened a checking account and had telephones installed in
Received from server -->the house and barn. Then they shut themselves up behind new deadboltlocks.   The house still looks sealed. Vulnerable and exposed alongsidethe highway, it could be abandoned but for the truck in the driveway
Received from server -->and the two figures sitting still as statues in the kitchen.   They greet prolonged knocking with silence. Eventually, theyrespond to introductions shouted through the locked door.   The gray sky is spitting snow, but inside an ancient stove warms
Received from server -->the kitchen. Harry's gold plaid chair is stationed by the sidewindow. Mike's green vinyl recliner guards the door. A Holstein and
Received from server -->her calf watch over them from a wall calendar, courtesy of EasternMilk Producers.   A paper bag worn thin as tissue paper holds their memories. Oneghostly snapshot shows two hardy young farmers in matching coverallsand caps sharing a joke. Side by side, they are broad-shouldered andhandsome, heads tipped back, mouths stretched wide, eyes crinkled
Received from server -->shut.   Slowly, stiffly, Mike hands the picture to Harry. Out of their
Received from server -->armchairs, both men are curved like question marks, fragile figureswho move gingerly about the kitchen.
Received from server -->   All along the valley in farmhouses much like the Dutchburns',doors and windows left unlocked for decades were bolted and sealedthat winter, and shotguns put away for next hunting season wereretrieved.
Received from server -->   Franklin County's 37,000 inhabitants had known crime, but mostlyof a different sort: patches of marijuana tucked away in a field, or
Received from server -->burglaries of unoccupied vacation homes owned by out-of-state
Received from server -->skiers. Not the sort of face-to-face crime that has people afraid to
Received from server -->come to the door at night.   ``There was talk of forming a posse. There was talk of lynchingand tarring and feathering _ an old-fashioned killing party,'' Sandyrecalls.   ``No hole is deep enough, no rock big enough, to hide scum like
Received from server -->you,'' neighbor James McGroarty wrote in a letter in the FranklinCounty Courier. ``I promise you, we'll find you and I pray to God
Received from server -->the police do before I or the other people in our town of Montgomery
Received from server -->do.''   Eventually, things quieted down. Two men went to jail and lifewent back to normal. Except for Mike and Harry.   This month brings another reminder. A lawsuit they filed againsttheir assailants goes before a district court jury. ``It's the
Received from server -->principle,'' Sandy says. ``My uncles are never going to be better.Why should two innocent people have to live this way?''
Received from server -->   The prospect of once again facing their attackers weighs on the
Received from server -->Dutchburns. They try to make light of it. ``We've gotten used to
Received from server -->going to court,'' Harry says, grinning faintly.   There is no getting used to the locked doors. Or the fear.
Received from server -->   Not long ago, yet another driver missed the curve by theDutchburns' and spun off the road into the field. He pounded ontheir door for a long time, but Mike and Harry sat very still.Eventually, he went away.

Received from server --><TEXT>   Like its huge and dominant neighborto the north, this ancient nation of herdsmen and miners, once ruled
Received from server -->by Genghis Khan, is restructuring its Marxist society.   But what the Soviets call perestroika, the Mongolians call``shinechel'' or renewal. And they are greeting the liberation of
Received from server -->the state-controlled economy and the infusion of democracy with anair of excitement.
Received from server -->   The old ways brought shortages in a land of plenty and politicaltimidity to a people of great warrior tradition.   Shinechel is still too new to claim many accomplishments, but
Received from server -->there are great expectations.   ``Before, we said that capitalism and socialism can't exist
Received from server -->together,'' says Puntagdasyn Luvsandorj, director of the Instituteof Economics of the State Planning Committee. ``Now we say they mustcooperate.''
Received from server -->   The main target of reform is the state monopoly on productionimposed in the 1960s on both industry and, more improbably, in rural
Received from server -->areas where people are scattered across a nation nearly the size ofWestern Europe, wandering the grasslands as semi-nomadic herdsmen.
Received from server -->   One consequence is that livestock numbers have stagnated at about23 million head since the early 1970s even though the humanpopulation has doubled, to about 2 million.   Half of the meat produced must be exported to the Soviet Union topay for Soviet goods and financial aid, leaving city residents to
Received from server -->stand in line, sometimes for hours, for scarce supplies of meat, thestaple of the Mongolian diet.   More than half the population has left the harsh life on thegrasslands for cities, putting further strains on food supplies.
Received from server -->   ``The food situation is getting worse,'' said one foreigndiplomat, noting that grain and vegetable farms, all run by the
Received from server -->state, are plagued by ``bad planning, bad management and badprofits.''   The government is now trying to spur meat production by
Received from server -->increasing the private stocks herdsmen are allowed to keep. Those inthe Gobi desert region can now keep 100 head, while those in other
Received from server -->parts of the country can keep 75. Farmers may now work small privateplots.
Received from server -->   Industry has fared better because of heavy investment and
Received from server -->technical assistance from the Soviet Union and other socialistnations, helping Mongolia develop its rich mineral resources.   In December, Mongolia's parliament passed an industrial law
Received from server -->giving factory directors greater authority over planning andinvestment. But it's three strikes and you're out. The governmentwill bail out money-losing enterprises only two times before they
Received from server -->are shut down.   ``Before, we didn't participate in selling our product, so we

Received from server -->Ulan Bator. ``Now, according to the new law, if we produce a goodproduct and can find a market, the living conditions of the managers
Received from server -->and workers will improve.''   Free markets, encouraged by the government, are still small butgrowing. Owners of private cars have gone into the taxi service, a
Received from server -->few small restaurants have appeared and private clothesmakers are
Received from server -->selling to retail cooperatives.   But the pace of economic change is likely to be slow, said oneforeign diplomat. ``It's such a vast country,'' he said, and ``there
Received from server -->is little pressure from below for privatization'' because people arerelatively prosperous and have known nothing but socialism since theMarxist state was founded in 1921, only four years after the Russian
Received from server -->revolution, making it the second oldest Marxist society in the world.   Faster change may come in the political sphere, where the ruling
Received from server -->Communist Party is debating an election law that for the first timewill allow direct multi-candidate elections.   The party is also trying to limit the role of party officials to
Received from server -->policy-making, and streamline the government. ``Marx and Lenin said
Received from server -->the roles of the party, the government and mass organizations shouldbe separate,'' said Kinayat Zardihan, a leading ideologist in the
Received from server -->party's Institute of Social Sciences. ``But in our country thisdifference has disappeared.''   As in the Soviet Union, the official press is encouraged to
Received from server -->condemn what are now regarded as errors of the past. The press nowspeaks openly about repression and political purges in the 1930s.Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal, ruler for 40 years until his ouster in 1984,is knocked for forcing collectivization in the 1960s while hisRussian wife is criticized for wielding too much power.
Received from server -->   Statues in Ulan Bator of Stalin, and other native oppressors,have recently been smeared with paint.   Zardihan said the party is now rewriting the nation's history toinclude the truth about events that have shaped the nation.
Received from server -->   One government official noted that before now everything thathappened before 1921 was regarded as bad, including the 12th and13th century advance of Genghis Khan's horsemen that created a
Received from server -->Mongol Empire stretching from the Danube to the coast of China.   President and party leader Jambyn Batmonh, a 62-year-old formerrector of the state university, is also hoping to ease his remote
Received from server -->and landlocked nation away from its near total dependence on theSoviet Union and other Soviet bloc nations.   Relations with China, with which Mongolia shares a 2,900-mile
Received from server -->border, show signs of improvement as Moscow and Beijing patch up olddifferences. Mongolia, which sided with the Soviet Union when itstwo giant neighbors split in 1960, sent home one division of Soviet
Received from server -->troops in 1987 and has now pledged to remove a ``considerablenumber'' of the remaining 50,000 Soviet troops guarding Mongoliafrom a potential Chinese attack.
Received from server -->   In early 1987, Mongolia and the United States establisheddiplomatic relations and are now negotiating cultural and consularagreements.
Received from server -->   Currently 97 percent of Mongolia's total annual trade of about$1.6 billion is with socialist countries, 80 percent with the SovietUnion. Those figures will be hard to change in the near future.
Received from server -->Mongolia receives about a billion dollars in aid and two-thirds of
Received from server -->its capital investment funds from the Soviet Union every year, which
Received from server -->locks it into shipping its ores, cashmere and meat to the socialist
Received from server -->bloc.   Officially, at least, Mongolians are full of praise for theSoviet Union, which helped build its cities and industry.
Received from server -->   Under Soviet-style socialism, Mongolia has become a nation ofalmost 100 percent literacy where 25 percent receive higher
Received from server -->educations. Medical and other welfare facilities are inexpensive andworker incomes average nearly 200 dollars a month, one of the higherfigures in Asia.

Received from server -->boys wearing narrow ties swivel to the disco beat of Americansingers Stevie Wonder and Whitney Houston.
Received from server -->   Upstairs, a 12-piece band belts out Mongolian hits from the 1930sas a more middle-aged crowd, some dressed in the traditional
Received from server -->robe-like ``del'' and high black riding boots, swirl around the room.   Despite the isolation _ in the winter the capital of Ulan Batoris accessible only by plane from Moscow or a 30-hour train ride from
Received from server -->Beijing _ signs of Western influence are seeping into this stolidlysocialist nation of 2 million.
Received from server -->   Foreign visitors must pay hotel and transportation bills withU.S. dollars and are frequently stopped on the street by
Received from server -->money-changers offering twice the official dollar rate for theMongolian currency, the tugrik.
Received from server -->   At the ``dollar store'' in Ulan Bator, Mongolians with American
Received from server -->or other Western money listen to a tape from a San Francisco radio
Received from server -->station program while buying British whiskeys, American toiletries
Received from server -->and Japanese radios.
Received from server -->   English, still rare in a country where studying Russian is
Received from server -->mandatory, is now taught on prime-time national television with a
Received from server -->series arranged through the British Embassy.
Received from server -->   The foreign influence, however, is predominantly Russian.
Received from server -->Thousands of Soviets _ engineers, technical advisers, traders and
Received from server -->soldiers _ live and work in Ulan Bator. The visage of Lenin peersfrom statues and billboards around the city, and a war memorial
Received from server -->jutting into the skyline from the top of a hill is dedicated toSoviet, not Mongolian soldiers.
Received from server -->   Central Ulan Bator _ which means ``Red Hero'' _ is a collectionof Soviet-financed columned government buildings and utilitarianapartment complexes, most painted in pleasant pastel shades of pink
Received from server -->and yellow. Mongolia must import most of its consumer goods, and 80percent of its trade is with the Soviet Union.
Received from server -->   Mongolia adopted the Russian Cyrillic script in 1946, and allschoolchildren must study Russian from the fourth grade on. Study of
Received from server -->the Mongolian script, suppressed for decades, was revived about fouryears ago, but classes only begin in the seventh grade.   Signs in the native script are rare, in contrast to Chinese Inner
Received from server -->Mongolia, where shops and offices frequently carry signs inMongolian for the Mongolian minority of 3 million.   About 6,000 Mongolian university and research students, the
Received from server -->nation's best and brightest, study in the Soviet Union.   The dependence on Soviet political and cultural reinforcement
Received from server -->goes back to 1921, when Soviet forces helped Mongolia drive out theChinese who had occupied the country for more than 200 years and setup the world's second Communist state.
Received from server -->   Soviet-style socialism was in part Mongolia's salvation, creatinga well-cared-for and well-educated nation. The cost to Mongolianheritage, however, was high.   At the turn of the century the Mongolian population was only
Received from server -->500,000 and in danger of being wiped out. Literacy was about 1percent. Forty percent of the male population lived in the nation's750 Buddhist lamaseries, one reason for the declining population.
Received from server -->   A Stalinist purge of the 1930s resulted in the closure of allmonasteries and the murder of many monks. Today the Gandan Monastery
Received from server -->in Ulan Bator, with 160 monks, is the only functioning Buddhisttemple in the country.   In the 1940s, the Mongolian script was suppressed and in the
Received from server -->1950s there was a campaign to ban wearing of the native costume.   Plans to celebrate the 800th birthday of the great Mongol warriorGenghis Khan in 1962 were scaled down as a result of Soviet
Received from server -->displeasure.   Mongolian culture persists in both the ``del,'' the usual form of
Received from server -->dress in the countryside, and the ``ger,'' or ``yurt,'' the round,canvas-colored tent which is still home to about half Ulan Bator's500,000 people.
Received from server -->   In the countryside, semi-nomadic herding remains the main way oflife despite collectivization of their herds of sheep, horses, cowsand camels.
Received from server -->   ``We need more settled animal husbandry to supply cities withmeat and milk,'' says O. Shagdarsuren, rector of the Mongolian StateUniversity.
Received from server -->   But Shagdarsuren, who grew up in a herdsman's family, saidMongolia should keep its nomadic ways. ``In settled husbandry peoplelive for the animals. In nomadic husbandry, the animals are always
Received from server -->working for man.''
Received from server -->   Mongolia is also working to ensure that its human population,which occupies only a tiny part of this Western Europe-sized nation
Received from server -->of steppes, deserts, forestland and mountains, will continue to grow.   A mother giving birth to her fourth child receives a 15-day
Received from server -->vacation at a state rest house and is eligible for retirement at 50.Further births means greater salary and pension benefits, and a
Received from server -->woman with eight children is awarded a ``first class medal of famousmothers.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC><DOC><DOCNO> AP890109-0273 </DOCNO><FILEID>AP-NR-01-09-89 2133EST</FILEID>

Received from server --><DATELINE>KARAKORUM, Mongolia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chultem Tumurbaatap is a socialist
Received from server -->nomad, a herdsman who wanders for the state across the endlesssteppes of Mongolia.   Tumurbaatap, 26, rides herd on 400 horses assigned to him by the
Received from server -->Karakorum State Farm, near the ruins of the ancient capital fromwhere the sons of Genghis Khan once conquered an empire stretchingfrom Eastern Europe to the Pacific.   Like his ancestors, he sets off every spring with his animals for
Received from server -->a half-year of seeking the green pastures of mountain hideaways,returning for a more settled life during the long and harshMongolian winters.
Received from server -->   But in socialist Mongolia, the young horseman receives a salary
Received from server -->for his labors, and other benefits such as paid vacations. The statefarm to which he belongs, of medium size, has 1,000 members and100,000 head of sheep, horses, cows and camels.
Received from server -->   Tumurbaatap, hosting visitors in the round, canvas-covered tent,or ``yurt,'' that is still common in both rural and urban Mongolia,
Received from server -->shyly brushed off suggestions that socialism might not be suited forthe wild and isolated life of a nomadic herdsman.
Received from server -->   He said he is paid $150 a month and his wife receives a similaramount for helping with the milking of the horses. He receives
Received from server -->bonuses for keeping the herd healthy and holding down losses fromwolves and winter winds.
Received from server -->   With the money, he has bought a generator-operatedblack-and-white television, a radio, a saddle with silver buckles, anew $1,600 yurt and a motorcycle. He said that in about 10 years he
Received from server -->might have enough to buy a car.
Received from server -->   Farm workers drive to his winter campsite about 9 miles outsidethe dirt-road town once a week with portable hot-water showers.
Received from server -->Movies, stores and performing troupes also make the rounds of the
Received from server -->grasslands and the farm provides a vehicle to help transport hisyurt when he is on the move.   His three infants, when they are ready for school, will receive
Received from server -->free boarding at the farm's school dormitory.   Turmubaatap, who trains horses for racing, said he did wish thestate would let him keep more private animals. Now he is allowed to
Received from server -->own only 10 head and a few of the foals born every year.   Socialist amenities have not softened the herdsman. ``I like the
Received from server -->snows in winter,'' he answers laconically when asked about life onthe steppes when the temperatures dip to minus-22 degrees Farenheit.
Received from server -->   Like other herdsmen, he wears a fur hat, high-pointed boots andthe ``del,'' the traditional long silk robe tied at the waist withan orange sash and with sheepskin lining in the winter. His
Received from server -->24-year-old wife, Bavuu Sanjaasuren, wears a similar outfit butsports nail polish and a fashionable white-striped knit hat.
Received from server -->   ``Horses don't like Western clothes,'' he said when asked why heprefers the native costume.   During the winter, the family eats mainly horsemeat, boiled on a
Received from server -->dung-heated iron stove in the middle of the yurt. The family,
Received from server -->including the children, keep warm by drinking ``airak,'' a mildlyalcoholic drink made from fermented mare's milk.   Tumurbaatap was stationed in the capital of Ulan Bator during a
Received from server -->three-year stint in the army, but says he's not attracted to citylife. ``I want to live in the countryside,'' he said. ``I like
Received from server -->horses.''

Received from server -->   Iowa farmer and hunter Norbert Bremertraveled 10,000 miles and spent $10,000 to get a shot at a ram onthe frozen, wind-lashed wasteland of the Gobi desert.
Received from server -->   ``I had a wonderful time,'' says Bremer, showing off the mightycurved horns of a Gobi ram, his trophy from one of the world's moreexotic safaris.
Received from server -->   He is one of some 350 hunters (out of 600 who apply) whom theMongolians allowed in last year. They control the number to preserve
Received from server -->the wildlife.   Bremer, 52, also tracked down a tall-horned Siberian ibex as partof the tour, and, for an extra $750, shot a blacktailed gazelle.
Received from server -->   He was the last hunter of 1988 to take the Gobi tour. He saidtemperatures in the Mongolian desert plunged to zero, and the windknifed through the treeless scrub at 30 mph.
Received from server -->   Bremer, who farms 880 acres of corn and soybeans in Ocheyedan,Iowa, says he read of the Gobi hunt in hunting magazines. For about
Received from server -->$6,500 the Mongolian tourist agency, Zhuulchin, provided in-countrytransportation, guides and attendants, and a license to shoot oneGobi sheep and one ibex.
Received from server -->   Bremer had to get here on his own, via Beijing.   He also paid a fee of $200 dollars for every inch of the ram'shorn in excess of 43{ inches.
Received from server -->   His kill had horns of 51 inches, which Bremer said may make therecord books.
Received from server -->   But the experience was more than the hunt. His party passednomadic herdsmen, some armed with rifles and riding camels andhorses as they tended their herds and flocks in the parched bush.
Received from server -->   The hunters lived in a yurt, the round tent-like home ofMongolian herdsmen, and were served by an interpreter, a driver, a
Received from server -->cook, a camp manager and a young woman who tended the stoves andskinned the animals.   The tourist agency also offers safaris to the woodlands of
Received from server -->central and northeast Mongolia, where elk, moose, deer and brownbear abound.
Received from server -->   G. Batsukh, deputy general director of Zhuulchin, said severalyears ago the government sold licenses to hunt the rare and
Received from server -->beautiful snow leopard found in the Altai range, claiming theleopard population had increased and was preying on cattle, yaks and
Received from server -->people. But he said only one or two of the white and black leopardswere killed, and shooting licenses are no longer issued.</TEXT>

Received from server -->crews of the U.S. Customs Service are on the front line in the war
Received from server -->on drugs.   Equipped with high-tech radar that can spot a plane 200 milesaway, they roam the skies at 20,000 feet or skim the waters of the
Received from server -->Gulf of Mexico.   They know the thrill of an airborne chase.
Received from server -->   ``It seems like what we're doing is an act of war,'' says radardetection specialist Steve MacDonald as he scans the skies on his
Received from server -->radar screen.   Using five four-engine P3 Orions the size of airliners and two
Received from server -->smaller twin-engine E2C Hawkeyes, the Customs Service runs itssurveillance detection operations here at the Corpus Christi NavalAir Station on the Gulf of Mexico.
Received from server -->   These crews have a tough job. They are responsible for patrolling
Received from server -->the vast Gulf and the U.S.-Mexican border from Texas to California.Their equipment often fails. They get little help from countriessouth of the border.
Received from server -->   The system of tethered radar balloons that will someday relieve
Received from server -->much of their border coverage is behind schedule _ only four of aplanned 17 are operating.   But they are excited about their new $20 million P3 outfitted by
Received from server -->its builder, Lockheed, with an airborne early warning (AEW) radar
Received from server -->dome on top _ similar to that of an Air Force Airborne Warning andControl plan (AWACS).   On this plane, radar operators sit at two computer keyboards,where they can track planes 200 miles away, assign color codes to
Received from server -->friendly and suspect aircraft, and direct Customs planes on a chase.
Received from server -->A second dome plane is due in April and Customs hopes for a total offour.   Stanley Adams, a Customs pilot and surveillance branch
Received from server -->supervisor, likened current detection coverage to hiding a pea in a
Received from server -->shell game. ``You keep moving the coverage around'' hoping to hitthe right place on the right night.
Received from server -->   This is not first-class flying. This is flying with erratictemperature controls that can leave you sweating, or can keep a sodaice cold without a refrigerator.
Received from server -->   This is flying on a roller coaster, because during a chase, thepilots have little time to find ``windows'' through rough weather.   This is flying in the three-seat radar compartment of an E2C,which is so narrow that a quarter turn of a chair is all the room
Received from server -->you have. It is so noisy on the plane built for aircraft carriersthat special earplugs are required.   Compared to the Hawkeye, the P3 is a luxury, with a refrigeratorand a microwave oven.
Received from server -->   On a recent winter's night, the P3 is patrolling over the Gulf ofMexico when a call from a Customs intelligence agent in Houston
Received from server -->sends the crew on a 200-mile chase.   The pilots gun the four prop-jet engines and the airspeed
Received from server -->indicator jumps from 240 knots to 360 knots.   As the plane bumps through the clouds, two radar operators search
Received from server -->for their target on their screens.   ``Did they say his lights were off?'' one crew member asks
Received from server -->another on the radio.   ``No self-respecting smuggler would keep his lights on,'' one of
Received from server -->the pilots responds.   The thrill of the chase, as happens too often, evaporates when
Received from server -->the P3 arrives in the target area. The suspect cannot be found,
Received from server -->perhaps because he had already landed at a remote airstrip.   Sometimes, though, the Customs fliers strike pay dirt.
Received from server -->   ``A couple of weeks ago we chased a plane that landed on CatIsland in the Bahamas,'' says radar operator Buck Benham. ``The drug
Received from server -->plane had dumped its load at the airport. We saw cars headed for theairport to pick up the drugs. We sent in a helicopter. They rounded
Received from server -->up the plane and pilot. We kept circling 150 feet off the ground

Received from server -->planes fly right over the top of vessels and then circle them to get anidentification.    ``I wonder what they think down there,'' says one crew
Received from server -->member as the four-engine plane buzzes a fishing boat.    As the planeskims the Gulf waters, the pilots have on their laps a list of suspicious
Received from server -->boats provided by Customs' intelligence officers.    A fishing boat is
Received from server -->spotted heading for the Alacran Reef about 80 miles from the Yucatan Peninsulaof Mexico. The reef has a sheltered lagoon and sheds, where Customs believesdrugs are stored.    The plane circles several times, and bingo _ one
Received from server -->of the boats on the intelligence list is spotted. The Coast Guard is notifiedand will send a cutter to see whether there are drugs aboard.    Customs'
Received from server -->chances of spotting suspicious planes increase dramatically when the P3radar dome plane is flying.    Radar operator Edward Smith locks ontoa target by simply touching the monitor. He sees the target's position,
Received from server -->course, speed and altitude.    As planes appear on the screen as littlesquares, Smith color-codes his displays: green for friendly planes, yellowfor unknown aircraft and red for hostile.    Smugglers often try to evade
Received from server -->detection by flying in an unusual air corridor at slow speed and low altitudewith no lights, small tail numbers or with their numbers painted over.
Received from server -->There is no transponder signal.    If the radar plane wants another Customsaircraft to tail a suspect, the computer is programmed to give the chaseplane the right heading and speed.    The computer screen displays the
Received from server -->angle needed for convergence, and keeps changing the speed, course andaltitude the Customs plane must maintain. There are two computer screensand each can handle three intercepts simultaneously.    Little crosses
Received from server -->on the screen automatically plot a smuggler's course, something that oncewas computed manually by an operator.    In the future, Customs command
Received from server -->centers thousands of miles away will be able to transmit their radarpictures to the flying platform and have the P3 direct a chase.    Whenthe AEW is flying, the four other P3s serve as long-range tracking planes
Received from server -->that can keep a suspect on their radar for hundreds of miles.    But overthe United States, the P3 will often call in a shorter-range tracker, possiblya jet interceptor, and a Blackhawk helicopter carrying a team of officers
Received from server -->who can land quickly and make arrests.    The job is not without danger.   Adams notes that the domed aircraft can be spotted from apartments
Received from server -->that line the bay outside the base. ``People can sit there with binocularsand can tell what time we're leaving.    ``We don't tell the tower wherewe're going. We're maneuvering all the time. We control the planning, go
Received from server -->on short notice and keep communications secure.''    Smith suspects thatair traffic controllers in Mexico ``can monitor our search patterns and
Received from server -->tip off smugglers.''    ``Look in the bay,'' he says. ``There are 30 or40 shrimpers working at night. All you need is a high frequency radio tocall bases in Mexico. We give fake return to base calls to flush these
Received from server -->guys out.''    Adams says politicians and publicity also often hindertheir effort.    During a special mission off Colombia last summer, whenP3s were based on the island of Curacao, the local island newspaper published
Received from server -->a story about the intense effort to detect airborne smugglers leaving Colombia.   During the recent Operation Alliance, a huge anti-drug operation along
Received from server -->the Southwest border, politicians lined up to announce the latest majoreffort in the war on drugs.    With such highly public operations as Alliance,Adams says, ``We might as well go home.''

Received from server --><NOTE>By JOHN BARBOUR</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><TEXT>
Received from server -->   Every year, more than 2 million Americans in some degree ofdesperation seek a ``second chance'' in life through divorce.   But a new look at this phenomenon finds that things are not
Received from server -->necessarily better the second time around and the chances of successare more elusive than was thought.   And society often forgets to think much about the 1 million or so
Received from server -->children a year who are involved in divorce, most of whom sense aloss of protection and fear of the future.   Furthermore, the study shows, the aftershocks of divorce echo
Received from server -->through the personal lives of all concerned at least a decade later.   Judith Wallerstein, a psychologist at the University ofCalifornia and founder of the Center for the Family in Transition,
Received from server -->has studied in depth 60 families for more than 10 years.   Her findings are to be published next month in a book, ``Second
Received from server -->Chances _Men, Women and Children a Decade After Divorce,'' writtenin collaboration with science writer Sandra Blakeslee. The sub-subtitle is even more provocative: ``Who Wins, Who Loses _ And Why.''
Received from server -->   Among the findings that Wallerstein discovered as ``new,scientific and unexpected,'' was ``that in most instances one personwas much better off.''
Received from server -->   ``One person is very important in life,'' she says. ``But theother member was, on balance, either in the same place or not doing
Received from server -->too well. You're looking at a much greater divergence after divorce,and that's entirely new.''   Who gets the major benefit of ``the second chance'' boils down to
Received from server -->who wanted the divorce, whether male or female.   Wallerstein says she is not against divorce. ``Divorce is muchmore than the coup de grace of a stressful marriage,'' she writes.
Received from server -->``It is a new beginning that offers people second chances. It is nomore and no less than an opportunity to rebuild lives. And there'sthe rub.''
Received from server -->   The book tells of the pitfalls, the expectations, the denial, andthe quiet dramas through the voices of those involved, andWallerstein has obviously won the trust and the understanding of
Received from server -->these people with whom she has been involved these many years.   ``In the book there are three major families we built on,'' she
Received from server -->says. ``I think those people started off equal... We ask, `Why didyou get married?' Almost all of them tell us they married for love.They thought they were equal. They weren't shotgun marriages because
Received from server -->someone got pregnant, although some of them were. By and large theyknew each other...   ``In some of the marriages that we see, there never was a
Received from server -->marriage, however one defines marriages in terms of love, intimacy,friendship. There was unhappiness, loneliness or violence _ whatever_ from the start.
Received from server -->   ``But in a whole group of these marriages, there was at somepoint a real marriage, and then it didn't endure for a whole lot ofdifferent reasons.''
Received from server -->   In fact, Wallerstein says, ``We're almost at the point in Americawhere we are beginning to know more about divorce than we know aboutmarriage.''
Received from server -->   She is tempted next to write about what it is that makesmarriages break up.   In investigating the aftermath of divorce she found that each
Received from server -->participant has a different view, even the children, although theyare almost unanimous in thinking that the divorce was a good thingfor their parents.
Received from server -->   Not so for the children. ``You're in a mine field of moralissues, because the children feel they are worse off,'' Wallersteinsays. ``I'm not sure they were, but they feel they were, and that's
Received from server -->an important distinction. I think in many ways they were betteroff.''   Nor is it a passing thing: ``Again this was a finding I didn't
Received from server -->expect. I was startled when I first looked at it. It crescendoes asthey move into young adulthood, as they are looking at an important
Received from server -->love affair, an important commitment. That's when they really worry:Am I going to be locked into what happened to my Mom and Dad.''   The children envy their friends who have two parents, Wallerstein
Received from server -->says. They have an idealized sense of a two-parent family. They feelthose other children are better protected. But they worry on behalfof themselves and their future children about the possibility of
Received from server -->betrayal.   There is a lot of premarital living together, yet these childrenof divorce are basically conservative, not believing in open
Received from server -->marriage, against what they see as cheating, in search of along-term commitment.   ``Now this is what they want,'' Wallerstein says. ``What they do
Received from server -->is often at odds with what they want.''
Received from server -->   Young women tend to get involved with a lot of young men,
Received from server -->apparently unafraid of getting hurt, Wallerstein says. ``It's acomplex picture we're looking at.''
Received from server -->   Ironically, when they are most in need of outside support, the
Received from server -->process is crippled. One parent or another may simply abdicate, just
Received from server -->when co-parenting is most important. That, in fact, is one of theprime remedies that Wallerstein would like to see set in place by
Received from server -->the divorce process.
Received from server -->   A lot of the children she studied, frequently the children ofupper-middle class professionals, never get to college because child
Received from server -->support ends at 18.   ``It's not fair,'' she says. ``In these families very few fathers
Received from server -->helped their children after age 18. They didn't all plead poverty.
Received from server -->It was a sense that they had done all that they were legallyobligated to do... I was surpised. I was very distressed. It wasn't
Received from server -->that they weren't seeing their children, but often there was a sortof blunting that had occurred.''
Received from server -->   Wallerstein would like to call this phenomenon to the attention
Received from server -->of society. Divorce is in many cases necessary and the best thingfor everyone concerned. But the sequelae need to be addressed.
Received from server -->   ``We saw as much anger between the parents 10 years later as
Received from server -->there was at the outset. It was not a cheerful finding. Theco-parenting was disrupted, the relationships between fathers and
Received from server -->children were disrupted, although a major finding was that at
Received from server -->adolescence there was a rising need for the father.   ``The divorce can become a remedy, a very important remedy for
Received from server -->one parent. But what's not recognized is how hard it can be for the
Received from server -->children, and that is something that can be changed.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE>

Received from server -->      EDITOR'S NOTE _ Membership in college fraternities has almost
Received from server -->doubled in the past 10 years, and unlike in their golden years ofthe 1950s there is little supervision or strict rules. But that may
Received from server -->be changing. A series of scandals involving hazing in the past
Received from server -->couple of years has tarnished the image of the brotherhoods andstirred an outcry for reforms.

Received from server -->   The 14 newly pinned college fraternitypledges, roused by the members' speeches and their own desire to
Received from server -->belong, were led downstairs into the darkened Lambda Chi Alphabasement and lined up in front of the bar.
Received from server -->   On went the lights, revealing the final stage of the pinningnight. There sat 200 ``kamikazes,'' a potent vodka concoction.   They drank.
Received from server -->   James Callahan of North Bergen drank until he dropped dead.   The 18-year-old's alcohol death last winter at Rutgers Universitywas one of a string of scandals at fraternity houses around the
Received from server -->country that have brought more pressure for reforms of theGreek-letter brotherhoods.   With their futures at stake, fraternities are responding.   Bars in many fraternity houses are being closed and advisers are
Received from server -->returning. And the National Interfraternity Conference is
Received from server -->considering a total ban on pledging.
Received from server -->   ``It's not easy to change the culture, but until we do I thinkthere are going to be very bad days ahead for fraternities,'' saysJohn Creedon, a Rutgers assistant provost. Since Callahan's death,
Received from server -->Creedon has led the push for fraternity reforms at Rutgers.   ``Fraternities are under fire as never before,'' says EileenStevens, a national anti-hazing activist. Mrs. Stevens has traveled
Received from server -->the country since her son died 10 years ago after drinking too much
Received from server -->during a hazing at Alfred University in upstate New York.
Received from server -->   ``Their very future is in jeopardy,'' Mrs. Stevens says. ``I
Received from server -->think we've come to a point where the people who supervise themrealize the problems are enormous, and they're just not sure what to
Received from server -->do about it.''   The problems boil down to two hard-dying traditions _ drinking
Received from server -->and hazing.   Critics call fraternities an anachronism.
Received from server -->   ``Fraternities have been engaged, like the brontosaurus, in a
Received from server -->futile struggle against a changed climate,'' Earl Smith, dean atColby College, wrote last year in the Chronicle of Higher Education.
Received from server -->Fraternities have been banned at Colby since 1984, whenadministrators decided they no longer fit in at the college in
Received from server -->Waterville, Maine.   Fraternity leaders say the scandals are relatively few, that
Received from server -->elitism charges are unfounded and that the positives such asfriendship, leadership development and community service far
Received from server -->outweigh any negatives.   But over the past two years, defenders of the fraternity system
Received from server -->have winced at a series of incidents. In addition to the Rutgersdeath:
Received from server -->   _our members of the University of Alabama chapter of Sigma AlphaEpsilon, the largest national fraternity, were arrested on charges
Received from server -->of selling cocaine. They were accused of making some of the drugdeals out of the stately chapter house.
Received from server -->   _At the University of Lowell in Massachusetts, six fraternity
Received from server -->members were charged under the state's tough anti-hazing law over astunt that sent a pledge to the hospital with a body temperature of
Received from server -->109. The members had bundled the victim in a sleeping bag and turnedon heaters nearby.
Received from server -->   _A former University of Delaware student claimed in a lawsuitthat someone dumped caustic oven cleaner over his head during a
Received from server -->fraternity ``Hell Night.''   But nothing stirred an outcry like Callahan's death at Rutgers.
Received from server -->It inspired nearly a dozen bills in the New Jersey Legislature andis cited by fraternity critics nationally.
Received from server -->   ``That probably had more impact on us than any other hazingincident,'' says Jonathan Brant, director of the National
Received from server -->Interfraternity Conference.   The reprisals against Lambda Chi Alpha were swift and harsh. The
Received from server -->Rutgers chapter was disbanded and the house doors slammed shut.   The 29 other fraternities were ordered to pull out their basement
Received from server -->bars, which had become standard equipment at Rutgers fraternities,and make other reforms.
Received from server -->   It could have been worse.</TEXT>

Received from server -->   In recent years, more than a dozen colleges have banned
Received from server -->Greek-letter organizations. Besides Colby, fraternities are passe at
Received from server -->Amherst College and the University of Lowell, both in Massachusetts,and Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa.
Received from server -->   At the Pennsylvania college, ``the trustees felt the fraternitieshad been reduced in many ways to underage drinking clubs,'' says
Received from server -->college spokeswoman Patti Lawson.   The mounting pressure against fraternities threatens what hasbeen a steadily rising membership.
Received from server -->   Undergraduate fraternity membership has climbed to 400,000,according to the interfraternity conference. That's more than double
Received from server -->the 1970 figures and a 170,000 increase since 1980.   Unlike the Greek system's golden age of the 1950s, this heydayhas come in a relatively unsupervised environment, campus
Received from server -->administrators note. Gone are the housemothers, strict rules and
Received from server -->other formalities that once characterized fraternity life.   But some college administrations are starting to reintroduce thesupervision. It's met with resistance from many fraternity chapters,
Received from server -->but some are starting to respond.   Resident advisers have moved into chapter houses on the
Received from server -->University of Southern California's fraternity row. Fraternitieshave gone completely dry at Indiana University, home to one of thestrongest Greek systems in the country.
Received from server -->   The fraternities' national magazines abound with denunciations ofalcohol abuse, sexism and racism.   A recent edition of Alpha Tau Omega's publication chronicles that
Received from server -->fraternity's efforts to halt a national liquor promotion geared tomale college students.   The governing body of Zeta Beta Tau voted in September to end
Received from server -->pledging, an idea being studied by the national Greek council.   Callahan's death came a few days after more than 40 Princeton
Received from server -->students were treated for alcohol poisoning following a drinkingbinge at two private social clubs.   Fifteen Lambda Chi Alpha members were charged with aggravated
Received from server -->hazing in Callahan's death. They have yet to come to trial, but aconviction would carry a maximum penalty of 18 months in jail and a$7,500 fine.   ``I've had calls from all across the country,'' says James
Received from server -->Meisel, a Hackensack lawyer who is representing Callahan's mother.``Among the people I've talked to _ university people, crusader
Received from server -->groups _ there's a consensus that as a general matter drinking isway out of hand on college campuses.''   Joseph Discenza, a lawyer for Lambda Chi's board of trustees,
Received from server -->acknowledges there was ``peer pressure'' for the pledges to drink.But Discenza contends that nobody was forced.   He says Callahan's own reckless behavior was to blame for his
Received from server -->death, which an autopsy attributed to 23 ounces of alcohol and a.434 percent blood alcohol content _ more than four times the legallimit.
Received from server -->   ``This one isolated incident says nothing,'' says Discenza, analumnus of the Rutgers Lambda Chi Alpha chapter. ``It says ifsomeone really wants to drink a lot they can. It could have happened
Received from server -->just as easily in my basement.''   Michael Steinbruck, a Delta Phi member, is leading a fightagainst the Rutgers administration's latest proposal for reform _ a
Received from server -->requirement that each chapter have an adult, live-in adviser.   Steinbruck, 23, has a scrapbook full of press clippings about hischapter's work raising money for New Brunswick homeless shelters and
Received from server -->other causes. He believes the university has ignored the good worksof fraternities and acted in a reactionary fashion to Callahan's
Received from server -->death.   ``People are so fed up with constantly being on the defensiveabout hazing, they're willing to try lots of different plans if they
Received from server -->feel they have a reasonable chance of succeeding,'' says PatrickBrown, president of the national fraternity council.   The goal, Brown says, is to reinforce the founding purposes of
Received from server -->friendship and scholarship and eliminate ``the basicirresponsibility, whether it is alcohol abuse, hazing, poorscholarship...
Received from server -->   ``Fraternity can be a magnificent educational movement if it'sappropriately directed. I'm convinced we're taking it in thedirection it has to go if we're to survive.''

Received from server -->   David Sanborn, probably the world's onlyprofessional alto saxophone player hosting a TV variety show, says
Received from server -->that even the sponsors seem surprised at the favorable ratings.
Received from server -->   Since October, Sanborn has been co-host of ``Sunday Night,'' aweekly late-night musical variety show on NBC affiliates. His
Received from server -->co-host is Jools Holland, keyboardist in the English pop bandSqueeze, who once hosted an English TV musical variety show, ``The
Received from server -->Tube.''   ``The ratings have been pretty good,'' Sanborn says. ``I think it
Received from server -->surprised everybody, the sponsors included. It's not exactly a
Received from server -->wonderful time slot, 12:30 Sunday nights.''   Sanborn, 43, had his first band and cut the first of his dozen
Received from server -->recordings in 1975. He played with the Chicago-style PaulButterfield Blues Band for four years starting in 1967. He also
Received from server -->toured with Stevie Wonder, Gil Evans, the Rolling Stones, David
Received from server -->Bowie, James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt, Rickie Lee Jones, the BreckerBrothers and others.
Received from server -->   He's been a semi-regular with the band on ``Late Night with DavidLetterman.''
Received from server -->   The idea for the variety show, he says, ``was presented to me asa situation where guest musicians would sit in with a house band and
Received from server -->it would be a pretty eclectic mix of musicians. That appealed to me.
Received from server -->   ``I thought it would be worthwhile doing, to show people whoordinarily wouldn't get to be on commercial TV, like Eddie Palmieri,
Received from server -->David `Fathead' Newman, Betty Wright, Al Green, Marianne Faithfull,NRBQ, Sonny Rollins, Slim Gaillard. If we can do something of high
Received from server -->quality on TV and people like it, we've accomplished something.''
Received from server -->   Working on ``Sunday Night,'' plus compiling a weekly radio jazzshow, has left Sanborn with no time to tour.
Received from server -->   ``I've been fairly successful,'' he says. I've been able to makea living and I'm very grateful for it. I didn't become a musician to
Received from server -->make a lot of money.''   On ``Sunday Night,'' Sanborn plays the saxophone every week.
Received from server -->   He says, ``On an ideal show, we get somebody contemporary and an
Received from server -->artist who has been around a longer time. Ivan Neville is a youngsinger and Ruth Brown has been around since the 1950s. That would be
Received from server -->a model show.   ``We'd like to get Robert Cray with Albert King, Eric Clapton
Received from server -->with Etta James, Bonnie Raitt with Koko Taylor. A great idea wouldbe Tammy Wynette and Elvis Costello. That's a tough one.''
Received from server -->   The biggest problem with ``Sunday Night'' so far, Sanborn says,
Received from server -->has been finding musicians whose touring schedules permit them toappear.
Received from server -->   Another problem is the lack of time for talk. ``It'sinfuriating,'' Sanford says. ``You have 30 seconds to do an in-depth
Received from server -->interview with a musician. There's no way you can avoid soundingsuperficial.''
Received from server -->   Sanborn's ``The Jazz Show'' is syndicated, for the third season,
Received from server -->to about 150 radio stations by Westwood One Radio Network.   Eating brown rice and millet during an interview in his small
Received from server -->Manhattan apartment, Sanborn, who is divorced, says, ``I try to livepretty healthy, given the schedule that I have.
Received from server -->   ``In an ordinary week, we rehearse Monday and Tuesday for TV,
Received from server -->tape Wednesday, rehearse Thursday and Friday, tape another showSaturday and do the radio show on Sunday. I don't know if I have the
Received from server -->stamina to keep the radio show going.''   He tours with a band in the summertime. ``In 1988, I was in
Received from server -->Europe, Japan, Hong Kong and had a few dates on the West Coast,'' hesays. ``This summer I'll tour in the States. I'll play a lot of
Received from server -->indoor-outdoor pavilions and 2,000 to 5,000-seat theaters. Most of
Received from server -->my audience is concentrated in the big cities.''   On his most recent album, ``Close-Up,'' on Reprise, Sanborn does
Received from server -->some jazz-style improvising. ``But I think the rhythmic orientation,which is to me what defines the idiom, is more rhythm 'n' blues than
Received from server -->jazz,'' he says.   His biggest selling album was ``A Change of Heart,'' out in 1987.
Received from server -->``After I do something, I kind of dump the information about it. I
Received from server -->remember that because it did so well. My last four or five albumshave sold around half a million. That one sold about 650,000.''
Received from server -->   Sanborn also practices every day, as he has been doing since hestarted playing saxophone at age 11 in St. Louis. ``David Newman and
Received from server -->Hank Crawford were my idols back then,'' he says. ``They were in Ray
Received from server -->Charles' band. I had their records and heard them live.   ``I had David Newman on `Sunday Night.' It was a real thrill.''

Received from server -->   When Nancy Dussault first saw ``Into the Woods,''the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical that opened on Broadway
Received from server -->more than a year ago, she thought, ``Gee, I could do that.''
Received from server -->   She could _ and eventually did.   In December, the buoyant musical comedy performer joined the cast
Received from server -->of the fairy tale musical as the Witch, a role originally played byBernadette Peters.
Received from server -->   For Dussault, the show is something of a homecoming, a roundaboutreturn to the Broadway theater after several long side trips, mostly
Received from server -->to television where she co-hosted ``Good Morning America'' and
Received from server -->appeared in the series ``Too Close for Comfort.''   Not that she was completely away from performing on the stage. In
Received from server -->fact, when Dussault got the call for ``Into the Woods,'' she was inMichigan starring in a production of ``Follies,'' another Sondheim
Received from server -->musical. The actress didn't hesitate to come to New York for herfirst Broadway show in 10 years.
Received from server -->   ``You don't get that many chances on Broadway anymore,'' she
Received from server -->says. ``Today, it's real hard. There's no place for kids to work.When they tell me, `I'm going into the musical theater,' my heart
Received from server -->stops.''   Dussault had no such problems when she began her own career which
Received from server -->started in the mid-1950s with a high school production of``Brigadoon.'' The little girl with the big voice later attended
Received from server -->Northwestern University as a music major and worked at a tent
Received from server -->theater in Highland Park, Ill., where one summer she did 12 shows.   ``We were so young,'' she recalls. ``What did we care how hard we
Received from server -->worked. But we had real training.''   Every day meant four hours of singing drills, then stage
Received from server -->exercises, improvisations, learning how to work so close to an
Received from server -->audience, and then lectures on grooming, makeup and weightmaintenance.
Received from server -->   ``I got a great education in the etiquette of theater,'' Dussaultsays. ``It was so valuable.''
Received from server -->   That education came in handy when she made her way to New Yorkand first made her name in small revues created by Julius Monk at
Received from server -->the famous Upstairs at the Downstairs.
Received from server -->   ``I loved doing revues, two shows a night at $100 a week,'' she
Received from server -->says. ``When I look at `Saturday Night Live' I'm sorry I was just alittle too old when it started. You want someone who does all the
Received from server -->accents and the insanities and sings, even upside down? Whatever youwant, I can do it.''   Her big Broadway break came in 1960 when she played the ingenue
Received from server -->in ``Do Re Mi,'' a musical that starred Phil Silvers. She won a
Received from server -->Theater World award and was nominated for a Tony.   After that, she never stopped working in the theater, at leastwhile Broadway kept doing big musicals. But big shows became fewer
Received from server -->and fewer.   ``I really thought I would always be able to make my living in
Received from server -->the theater,'' Dussault says. ``And I did for a long, long time.''   Eventually she realized that to be hired for the theater, you had
Received from server -->to have a name, and making a name meant California and television.
Received from server -->   ``I had to go do that, and it made me desperately unhappy,''Dussault says. ``I just wanted to sing and dance. I grew up with
Received from server -->those kinds of movies. And I didn't understand the impact oftelevision. As it turned out, I like doing television a lot,especially the quickness of it.''
Received from server -->   She plunged into TV, guest-starring on scores of televisionshows. Today, audiences remember her best as the original co-host on
Received from server -->``Good Morning America'' and as Ted Knight's wife on ``Too Close forComfort'' for much of the 1980s. That job provided steady
Received from server -->employment, lasting six years.   ``People criticized our show as a silly little sitcom,'' she
Received from server -->recalls. ``But I said, `No, we worked real hard, and we tried tomake it good.'''
Received from server -->   In between, there were short tours or limited engagements eachyear in shows like ``I'm Getting My Act Together and Taking It on
Received from server -->the Road'' or the Michigan engagement of ``Follies.'' But you can'tplay the ingenue forever, and those roles were for older women.
Received from server -->   ``I'm very aware of how long I've been in the business and what
Received from server -->my age is,'' she says. ``I'm not a child anymore. I know the rolesare changing for me. And I try not to be frightened by it.''   That's why she jumped at the chance to play the Witch in ``Into
Received from server -->the Woods.'' Besides Peters, such diverse actresses and singers asPhylicia Rashad of ``The Cosby Show'' and Cleo Laine have tackled it.
Received from server -->   ``I kind of like coming into a show that's already running ratherthan go through all the rigamarole of getting a new musical on,''
Received from server -->Dussault says.   Besides, the role gave her a chance to work with Sondheim, who
Received from server -->wrote the music and lyrics for ``Into the Woods.''   ``He is our guiding light,'' she says. ``I don't quite know how
Received from server -->to articulate it. I guess I think he's a genius. He has such passionfor his job, and he works at it so hard.
Received from server -->   ``And he fortunately has gotten into a position when people willalways pay attention to what he is doing _ and rightly so. He's
Received from server -->unique.''   Sondheim went over the music with Dussault, explaining the
Received from server -->rhythms and the orchestrations, particularly how they work to conveyemotions.
Received from server -->   What happens when her ``Into the Woods'' contract is up in sixmonths?
Received from server -->   ``I've been threatening for years to do a one-woman show,''Dussault says. ``My biggest problem is trying to decide what that
Received from server -->would be. Whether it should be a conglomeration of songs or have atheme. Either way, it's a lovely way to continue working in the
Received from server -->theater.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE>

Received from server --><DATELINE>PLYMOUTH, Montserrat (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>
Received from server -->   This island of 12,000 people has beenBritish since 1783, but a carved wooden shamrock perches on the
Received from server -->colonial governor's roof and an immigration officer will stamp theIrish symbol in your passport.
Received from server -->   Montserrat, a pear-shaped haven of densely forested mountains,palm trees, multicolored flowers and gray-black volcanic beaches
Received from server -->between Antigua and Guadeloupe, is a hint of Ireland in theCaribbean.
Received from server -->   Tourist brochures call it the Emerald Isle, St. Patrick's Day is
Received from server -->a legal holiday and a version of Irish stew is a local delicacy.   Although the population is 98 percent black and the climate
Received from server -->semitropical, you can flip through the telephone book and imagineyourself in Killarney. Row after row of Ryans, Rileys and O'Garros.
Received from server -->   Both the head of government and his main rival are named Osborne:
Received from server -->Chief Minister John and opposition leader Bertrand, a distant cousin.   Driving around Montserrat, a hilly 11 miles long and seven wide,
Received from server -->you pass St. Patrick's, Cork Hill, Sweeney's Estate, Carr's Bay,Bransby Point and Galway's Soufriere, a volcanic crater of bubblingsulfur.   In the north, you find the most Irish Montserratians of all, the
Received from server -->so-called black Irish, who make up 10 percent of the population andare as likely as not to speak with a hint of brogue and have a tinge
Received from server -->of red in the hair.   Most other Montserratians are descendants of slaves who tooktheir masters' names after emancipation in 1832, when Irish people
Received from server -->greatly outnumbered English on the island.   Anthropologist John Messenger of Ohio State University said theblack Irish descend directly from legal marriages in the 17th
Received from server -->century between African slaves and Irish plantation owners, and
Received from server -->Irish customs were passed down through the centuries.   ``They are very close-knit and inbred,'' he said, and threefamily names predominate: Gibbons, Sweeney and Allen.
Received from server -->   Among them, Messenger found Montserrat's last known Irish fiddlera few years ago. ``He held the fiddle in the crook of his arm and
Received from server -->his daughter did an Irish stepdance,'' the anthropologist said.   Messenger and his wife Betty, a fellow anthropologist at Ohio

Received from server -->the serrated mountains and abbey of Montserrat in Spain. The Englishsettled Montserrat in the early 1600s, and gained undisputed controlin 1783 after a series of wars with the French.
Received from server -->   John Messenger said there is historical evidence the Irisharrived in two separate groups in the same year, 1632, and settled
Received from server -->on different parts of the island. One contingent came from nearbySt. Kitts and the other from Jamestown in Virginia Colony, both to
Received from server -->escape Protestant persecution, he said.   Before long, the Irish outnumbered the English on Montserrat.   They established many of the sugar, lime and tobacco plantations
Received from server -->worked by imported slaves. A census record in 1678 gave thepopulation as 52 Scots, 761 English, 992 slaves and 1,869 Irish.
Received from server -->   Irish people settled throughout the Caribbean but became
Received from server -->concentrated here.   Messenger said there was little awareness of the the island's
Received from server -->Irish past until he and his wife wrote several articles for theIrish Times of Dublin in 1967 and lectured in Ireland.   Since then, two films on the black Irish have been shown in
Received from server -->Europe and the Irish and Irish-Americans have become interested.
Received from server -->   ``We got the ball rolling,'' the anthropologist said.   He said the Montserrat tourist industry has promoted the Irishconnection in hopes of attracting Irish-Americans, an estimated1,500 to 2,000 of whom visited last year.   Most islanders don't seem all that interested, however. Howard

Received from server --><HEAD>AIDS Fear Leads To Clotting Factor Shortage For Hemophiliacs</HEAD><BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
Received from server --><TEXT>   Perhaps the best thing that ever happened to 20,000
Received from server -->Americans with the bleeding disease hemophilia was the discovery oftreatment with a protein called factor VIII. It was also probably
Received from server -->the worst.   Five-minute infusions of this natural substance overcome their
Received from server -->bodies' inability to form blood clots so they can lead nearly normallives. But the price has been disastrously high: The treatments alsohave given more than half of them AIDS infections.
Received from server -->   The treatment has been made safe again, but another crisis looms.Factor VIII is in severe, sometimes life-threateningly short supply.   ``In the New York region, we've used 30 to 40 percent less
Received from server -->clotting factor'' in 1988, said Dr. Richard Lipton of Long IslandJewish Medical Center. ``I don't know if I can say anyone has diedbecause of this, but we have had some pretty hairy situations tryingto find factor VIII for people who are bleeding.''
Received from server -->   Doctors say that because of the shortage, most non-emergencysurgery has been postponed for hemophiliacs. Bleeding often istreated with less than the recommended doses, sometimes with poor
Received from server -->results. Users have smaller reserves for emergencies. Most have
Received from server -->stopped taking preventive doses and now use clotting factor only foractual bleeding.   They also have had to rely more on cryoprecipitate, an older,
Received from server -->less convenient therapy that requires a trip to the hospital to
Received from server -->receive blood plasma that is rich in factor VIII. This treatment
Received from server -->carries the same very slight risk of AIDS as an ordinary bloodtransfusion.   The shortage ``has produced a tremendous amount of frustration,
Received from server -->and in some people despair, in some anger and in some resignation,''
Received from server -->said Donald S. Goldman, a lawyer from West Orange, N.J., who hashemophilia.
Received from server -->   Hemophiliacs represent just 1 percent of the 80,000 AIDS cases
Received from server -->reported in the United States since 1982. However, a largerproportion of them are infected than are the other two major risk
Received from server -->groups, homosexual men and drug addicts.   About 60 percent of U.S. hemophiliacs are infected, and for those
Received from server -->with the most severe form of the disease it's perhaps 80 percent to
Received from server -->90 percent, said Alan Brownstein, executive director of the NationalHemophilia Foundation.
Received from server -->   While most of the hemophiliacs who carry the AIDS virus are stillhealthy, doctors fear that many of them will eventually get AIDS.
Received from server -->   Hemophilia is caused by a genetic defect passed from mothers tosons at conception. Victims don't produce enough factor VIII, one
Received from server -->link in the chemical chain reaction that prompts the body to stop
Received from server -->bleeding. Without treatment, cuts may bleed for days, but the mostcommon problem is bleeding internally. Bleeding into the joints
Received from server -->causes crippling deformities.   Once, the only treatment for hemophilia was blood transfusions.Then blood plasma was substituted. In the 1960s, cryoprecipitate
Received from server -->became the standard. Finally, in the 1970s, factor VIII became
Received from server -->available. Instead of 30 to 50 trips a year to a hospital for
Received from server -->infusions, people with severe cases could quickly treat themselves
Received from server -->at work or at home.   ``We are talking about people who, aside from the horrible AIDStragedy, have been liberated by clotting factor,'' said Brownstein.
Received from server -->``A person with hemophilia can do any job now. If they have aspontaneous bleeding episode, they can mix their preparations andinfuse themselves on the spot. They can do it as conveniently in a747 as in their own living room.''   Factor VIII is derived from human blood. It takes about 30 liters
Received from server -->to produce enough clotting factor for one treatment. In commercialproduction, blood plasma from many people is mixed together. A
Received from server -->single dose may contain elements of blood from 20,000 people or more.   No one knew it at the time, but during late 1970s and early1980s, AIDS virus in the donated blood passed through thepurification process into the factor VIII. In 1982, the U.S. Centers
Received from server -->for Disease Control reported the first three suspected cases of AIDSamong hemophiliacs.   In 1984, manufacturers began heating the clotting factor in aneffort to kill HIV, the AIDS virus, and a year later, a test became
Received from server -->available to screen donated blood for the virus. Since then, factorVIII makers have adopted other cleansing techniques, includingdetergents and antibodies.   Since 1985, only 18 new AIDS infections have been documented,said Brownstein, who believes the latest strategies have made
Received from server -->clotting factor HIV-free. But they have also made it expensive andscarce. The new processes yield only about half as much factor VIIIper liter as the earlier techniques.   Robert W. Reilly, president of the American Blood ResourcesAssociation, an industry group, said the price has risen six- toseven-fold since 1985. Enough clotting factor for one person nowtypically costs about $50,000 a year, Brownstein said.   The price and supply were also affected by low demand foralbumin. Until recently, factor VIII was simply a by-product of the
Received from server -->business of producing albumin, which was used to restore bloodvolume after surgery and burns. However, albumin is being replacedby newer treatments.   Factor VII was already in short supply at the start of 1988. Butthe situation became much worse because of problems at the AmericanRed Cross, which produces about 20 percent of the country's clottingfactor.
Received from server -->   Last April, the Red Cross discovered it had allowed factor VIIIto be made from blood that should have been discarded because ofpotential AIDS contamination. Dr. S. Gerald Sandler, vice president
Received from server -->for blood services, said that most of this was from people whoseblood twice tested positive for HIV during initial screening but was
Received from server -->shown by later confirmatory tests to be safe.   These donations were thrown out, but the donors were laterallowed to give blood again. This time their blood passed theinitial screening test. However, because of their earlier positive
Received from server -->results, acceptance of the blood was a violation of Food and DrugAdministration rules.
Received from server -->   Since then, the Red Cross has released little factor VIII,
Received from server -->although it recently resumed production. Meanwhile, about 7 percentof the nation's usual annual production is on hold. Officials of theRed Cross and FDA believe it is safe. But because of errors in theway it was produced, FDA officials say they would be breaking their
Received from server -->rules if they allowed its release.   Paul Parkman, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics
Received from server -->Evaluation and Research, said the FDA might allow the questionable
Received from server -->factor to be released as an experimental drug. Users would have tosign consent statements acknowledging that they understood the
Received from server -->protein did not meet federal standards.   Brownstein said that last year, 675 million units of factor VIIIwere available in the United States, and 591 million were used. In
Received from server -->1988, about 450 million units were available, and virtually all ofit was used.   Reilly said the major commercial makers expect to improve
Received from server -->production during 1989, and with the Red Cross back in business, the
Received from server -->shortage should begin to ease during the second half of 1989.</TEXT>

The solar cookers, designed by two Arizona women, are beingintroduced in the Third World by Pillsbury Co. ``We feel the
Received from server -->potential of solar cookers is so great that it could truly alleviatesome of the global problems,'' said William H. Sperber, a seniorresearch microbiologist at the food conglomerate.
Received from server -->   The United Nations estimates 1.5 billion people are affected by
Received from server -->firewood shortages, said Robert Metcalf, a microbiologist atCalifornia State University-Sacramento who attended graduate school
Received from server -->with Sperber at the University of Wisconsin 20 years ago and isworking with Pillsbury.   ``They've got a lot of sunshine, but they don't know how to useit,'' Metcalf said. ``It's fun in the United States, it can be very
Received from server -->useful, but it's critical in developing countries.''   The cooker is an insulated box within a box topped with a glasspane and a reflector that directs sunlight. It can be made out of
Received from server -->cardboard or wood, and aluminum foil. Food is cooked in dark,covered metal, glass or ceramic pots.
Received from server -->   The temperature peaks at 250-275 degrees, meaning food takeslonger to cook than in electric ovens. But Metcalf says users save
Received from server -->time by no longer having to collect firewood and by not having tostir the food because of the low heat.
Received from server -->   Metcalf, who has been promoting the solar cooker since 1979, wasjoined by Pillsbury in 1986. He and Sperber have demonstrated it in
Received from server -->Africa and South and Central America. Pillsbury is spending morethan $100,000 on the program.
Received from server -->   Simplicity may be an obstacle to widespread adoption, supporterssay.
Received from server -->   ``It doesn't look as high tech as other things that have been
Received from server -->tried,'' said Chris Flavin, vice president of research at Worldwatch
Received from server -->Institute, a private non-profit research group that focuses onglobal resource issues.
Received from server -->   ``There's an actual bias in development agencies against anything
Received from server -->that's small and decentralized,'' said Flavin. ``They like tosupport big projects because they're easy to manage.''
Received from server -->   Flawed cookers produced before the Arizona women designed theirsalso have discouraged widespread use. They tipped easily,temporarily blinded users, had reflectors that fell off and wereable to cook only one pot of food at a time.
Received from server -->   Barbara Kerr of Taylor, Ariz., a nurse, and Sherry Cole of Tempe,a former free-lance writer and neighbor of Kerr's, created thedesign in the mid-1970s. Since then, Cole said, they've sold about3,000 kits and cookers ranging from $40 to $275 and several thousandplans, from $1 to $3.75.   Sperber and Pillsbury became involved in 1986 while working inBolivia with the Freedom from Hunger Foundation, a private,
Received from server -->nonprofit group, on the problems of lack of firewood, high infant
Received from server -->mortality and diarrhea. Metcalf and scientists from Pillsbury'sTechnology Center have worked to simplify the design so it can bebetter mass produced and more easily assembled in the field.   By trial and error, Metcalf and his family have developed recipesthat work with the cooker. Vegetables, which contain moisture, don'tneed to be cooked in water, they discovered after one ``soggy
Received from server -->mess.'' Chicken can be cooked in three hours but can't be overcooked
Received from server -->because the low temperature won't turn moisture in the food tosteam, dry out the food and burn it. The normal amount of water isadded to dried grains, such as rice, and to beans.   ``They're cooking their corn and beans today in Guatemala ... in
Received from server -->these types of cookers and really taking control of their lives,''he said. ``This is what I want to see happen in hundreds ofthousands of places around the world.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Jan. 12</NOTE>

Received from server -->   ``A great many people on phone-in programs in America seemed tofind it rather a relief,'' said Storr, whose book, published byMacMillan Inc., was No. 6 for 1987 on The Washington Post
Received from server -->non-fiction best-seller list.
Received from server -->   On ``Jan Black's Journal,'' a radio call-in show on KCBS in SanFrancisco, many callers ``thought of themselves as weird _ becausewe are such a social society _ but they had a desire or need tospend time by themselves. It gave them a certain sense of reliefthat someone with his credentials said it's OK,'' said producerCharlotte Lantz.   ``I remember one caller in particular, a woman, who gave a big
Received from server -->kind of sigh of relief, after all the pressure to be with people,''said Cordelia Maloney, producer of ``Extension 720,'' a call-in showon WGN radio in Chicago.   ``Particularly in the U.S., Canada and Western Europe there is acultural bias that people who want to be alone have something wrong

Received from server -->professor Peter Suedfeld, dean of the Graduate Faculties at the

In the 1970s, Suedfeld studied prisoners in solitary confinementand found that generally ``what they object to is not being alone,but to harassment of guards, cold food, things like that.'' Someeven ``popped a guard in the nose'' to get put into solitary when

Received from server -->   ``We need times when we don't have too much input.''   And not just input from people, he said. ``We've got to a kind ofstage where people feel that if they haven't auditory stimulation,something's wrong.
Received from server -->   ``If they didn't have the radio on, they might have some moreinteresting thoughts. I always walk out of shops if there is musicgoing on.''
Received from server -->   People's fear of being without sounds comes from fear ofthoughts, Storr said. ``They don't want to face what they really

Received from server -->   Dr. Arnold Modell, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard
Received from server -->University, said, ``People need to maintain an area of themselvesthat does not communicate with other people. That hasn't been known
Received from server -->as a basic human need, even among psychoanalysts. But most artists

Received from server -->   Asked why many readers seem to react with such relief toward
Received from server -->``Solitude,'' Dr. Arnold Richards, a New York Psychoanalytic Societyspokesman, said people often confuse life with psychoanalytic

Received from server -->Survey says.
Received from server -->   The 278-page atlas of satellite images of Antarctica is the first
Received from server -->chapter in ``Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World,'' an11-chapter volume being prepared by the agency. The complete atlas
Received from server -->will provide a global snapsnot of glaciers as they were photographedin the 1970s by the Landsat satellite.

Received from server --><NOTE>Improvements In Fat Suction Surgery Safety</NOTE><DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A computerized suction pump and monitorcan help surgeons remove the right amount of fat and prevent
Received from server -->dangerously excessive blood loss in patients undergoing cosmeticliposuction surgery.   Liposuction is the most common U.S. plastic surgery proceduredone for aesthetic purposes, says the Illinois-based AmericanSociety of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, which published a
Received from server -->study about the pump-monitor in the Journal of Plastic andReconstructive Surgery.   During liposuction, the surgeon inserts a small, blunt-tipped
Received from server -->metal tube into a pocket of fat, commonly in the hips, thighs orabdomen. A suction pump connected to the tube sucks the fat into a
Received from server -->bottle.
Received from server -->   But even a small amount of blood turns the bottle's contents darkred, so blood loss is difficult to determine, said Dr. Harvey Lash,a plastic surgeon at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation and nearby
Received from server -->Stanford University.   ``The exact determination of blood loss ... is important'' toprevent shock or anemia, Lash said. ``Guess or estimate may not
Received from server -->allow the precise replacement of blood and fluids needed for thesafety of the patient.''
Received from server -->   Precise measurement of fat removal also helps surgeons suck thesame amount of fat from both sides of the body to give a balancedappearance.   The new pump has a color monitor that instantaneously shows theamount of blood and fat removed. Lash and his colleagues were amongthe first to test the device, which was developed by his son,
Received from server -->physician-engineer Bob Lash, and is now being marketed nationally.   The device monitors fat and blood loss using two electrodes in
Received from server -->the bottle. Fat cells don't transmit electricity, but bloodtransmits it well. The device determines the ratio of removed bloodand fat by measuring the amount of electricity that moves from oneelectrode to another.

Received from server --><BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   If you are still reeling from having to deal
Received from server -->with a thoroughly rewritten federal income tax last year, takeheart. This year there are only a few changes _ and most of them arebeneficial.
Received from server -->   There's another bit of good news. Because April 15 falls on aSaturday, you have two extra days to file your 1988 return.
Received from server -->   Most of the changes enacted by Congress in 1986 were in effectwhen returns were filed last year. Deductions for sales taxes andfor two-earner couples were repealed; the preference for capital
Received from server -->gains was wiped out; Individual Retirement Accounts were limited,and new restrictions were placed on deductions for consumer interest
Received from server -->and medical and miscellaneous expenses.   Those changes paid for lower tax rates and for higher exemptions
Received from server -->and standard deductions.
Received from server -->   For 1988 returns, exemptions and standard deductions are higherstill, and most people will find their rates have dropped again. The
Received from server -->most significant change that could bring higher taxes for somepeople is a further tightening of the deduction for consumerinterest.   The major changes:   PERSONAL EXEMPTION: You may exempt from taxation $1,950 foryourself, your spouse and each dependent, up from $1,900 last year.A student or other person who can be claimed as an exemption by
Received from server -->another _ such as a parent _ may not take an exemption on his or herown return.   STANDARD DEDUCTIONS: A couple that does not itemize deductionsmay reduce income subject to taxation by $5,000; for a single
Received from server -->person, the deduction is $3,000; for a head of household, $4,400;
Received from server -->for a married person filing a separate return, $2,500. In each case,
Received from server -->a person over 65 or blind gets a higher deduction; for example, a
Received from server -->married couple over 65 with one spouse blind and filing jointly isallowed $6,800. A person who can be claimed as a dependent is
Received from server -->allowed as little as $500, depending on type and size of income.   TAX RATES: Last year, there were five rate brackets, from 11
Received from server -->percent to 38{ percent. Now there are four: 15 percent, 28 percent,
Received from server -->33 percent, and 28 percent again. For most taxpayers, it makes nodifference how many rates there are, since they still determine how
Received from server -->much they owe by looking at a tax table. The net result is thatunder the new law, most people will pay a smaller part of theirtaxable income to the government _ although more of their income may
Received from server -->be taxable.   MORTGAGE INTEREST: A homeowner now may deduct interest on up to$1 million of debt used to acquire one or two homes plus up to
Received from server -->$100,000 of home-equity loans. There are no restrictions on how theequity loan can be spent.   CONSUMER INTEREST: Only 40 percent of interest paid on loans for
Received from server -->education, automobiles, credit cards and other personal debt isdeductible on 1988 returns, down from 65 percent the previous year.   INVESTMENT INTEREST: Deductible interest paid to make investments
Received from server -->is limited to net investment income plus $4,000. Any excess may be
Received from server -->``carried over'' into future years and deducted against investment
Received from server -->income.
Received from server -->   EARNED-INCOME CREDIT: This benefit for lower-income working
Received from server -->families with dependent children has been increased to a maximum of
Received from server -->$874, up from $849. Families with earned income as high as $18,756may qualify, up from $15,432 in 1987.   MUTUAL FUNDS: Publicly offered mutual funds will not reportcertain operating expenses as income to shareholders for 1988 and1989; thus, shareholders will not have to report such amounts as
Received from server -->income or write them off as miscellaneous deductions. This is the
Received from server -->same treatment allowed for 1987.</TEXT></DOC>

Received from server -->   The new federal tax law has raised the tax-freelevel to the point that a married couple under 65 may have total
Received from server -->income of up to $8,899 and not have to file a return.
Received from server -->   Just two years ago, a couple had to file if income was $5,830 ormore, as did a single person whose income was at least $3,560. Now,a single person under 65 need not file until income hits $4,950.   Whether you have to file depends on your income and your filingstatus. You must file if your income is more than the total of the
Received from server -->personal exemptions for yourself and any spouse plus your basic
Received from server -->standard deduction.   In most cases, the filing thresholds are higher if one or both
Received from server -->spouses is over the age of 65. But they do not increaseautomatically because of blindness, as the standard deduction does.   Most married couples will find it advantageous to file a joint
Received from server -->return, even though both spouses earn income. But there areexceptions, and the only way to be certain you are making the right
Received from server -->choice is to figure your taxes twice _ once on a joint return andonce on separate returns.   Here are guidelines for the various filing statuses:
Received from server -->   MARRIED FILING JOINTLY: You must have been married on Dec. 31,
Received from server -->1988; although there is no requirement that you and your spouse beliving together, you may not be legally separated. Each spouse is
Received from server -->liable for the full amount of tax, even though one earned no income.The filing thresholds: $8,900 if both spouses are under 65; $9,500
Received from server -->if one is 65 or older, and $10,100 if both are 65 or older.
Received from server -->   MARRIED FILING SEPARATELY: The definition of ``married'' is thesame as with a joint return. But if you file separately, the filingthreshold is $1,950 regardless of age. You report only your income
Received from server -->and none of your spouse's, and claim only your deductions. If onespouse itemizes deductions, so must the other.   Some people may save money by filing separately. For example, ifone spouse has a large amount of medical or unreimbursed employee
Received from server -->expenses, more of those deductions could be claimed by filingseparately.   That is because only medical expenses exceeding 7.5 percent of
Received from server -->adjusted gross income and only miscellaneous expenses exceeding 2
Received from server -->percent of AGI may be deducted. If, for example, you have $5,000 ofunreimbursed medical expenses, it would be easier to exceed 7{percent of your income than to exceed 7{ percent of the combinedincome of both spouses.
Received from server -->   HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD: If you qualify for these tax rates, which areabout midway between those for singles and couples filing jointly,
Received from server -->you will have to file a return if income is $6,350 or more, assuming
Received from server -->you are under 65, or at least $7,100 if 65 or older.   In general, you qualify if:
Received from server -->   _ You were unmarried at yearend (or your spouse did not live inyour home during the last six months of the year), and:
Received from server -->   _ You paid over half the cost of maintaining your home as theprincipal residence of your unmarried child or grandchild, or of a
Received from server -->married child or grandchild whom you can claim as a dependent, or ofany other relative whom you can claim.
Received from server -->   SURVIVING SPOUSE: If your spouse died last year and you did not
Received from server -->remarry, filing thresholds are the same as for a married couplefiling jointly. You may claim a $1,950 personal exemption for your
Received from server -->spouse and file a joint return for 1988. As a rule, you may usejoint tax rates _ but not claim an exemption for the spouse _ for
Received from server -->two additional years following the year of death of a spouse if you
Received from server -->furnish over half the cost of keeping a home for your dependentchild.
Received from server -->   SINGLE: You must file if income is $4,950 or more, if under 65;or $5,700, if 65 or older. You are considered single if you were
Received from server -->legally separated or unmarried on Dec. 31, 1988.   The rules are different if you can be claimed as a dependent by
Received from server -->someone else. If all your income was earned _ wages, tips,scholarships _ your filing threshold is $3,000. If you had any
Received from server -->earned income, such as interest and dividends, and you are under 65,
Received from server -->your threshold is $500. The figure rises to $1,100 if you aremarried and 65 or older, and to $1,250 if you are single and 65 or

Received from server -->   Think back to 1986, when Congress passed andPresident Reagan signed a sweeping overhaul of the income tax.
Received from server -->Remember all the crowing about how there would be only two simpletax rates? Forget it.
Received from server -->   Look at the 1988 tax rate schedules in your package of tax forms
Received from server -->and you'll see there actually are four marginal rates: 15 percent,28 percent, 33 percent and 28 percent again.
Received from server -->   Where simplicity is concerned, as long as there is more than onerate, it makes little difference whether there are two or 20.
Received from server -->   That is because the great majority of taxpayers have no contactwith tax rates when they fill out their returns. Unless you have
Received from server -->taxable income _ which is what is left after subtracting personal
Received from server -->exemptions and deductions from your income _ of $50,000 or more, yousimply look at the tax tables, find your income, read across the
Received from server -->page to your filing status and see what you owe.   About four of every five taxpayers will pay only the lowest rate,
Received from server -->15 percent, on money earned last year. These people have taxable
Received from server -->incomes of up to $17,850 if single and up to $29,750 if married andfiling joint returns.
Received from server -->   When President Reagan proposed across-the-board tax cuts in 1981,his goal was to give people incentive to work more and save more in
Received from server -->ways that would improve the economy. He proposed to do this bycutting ``marginal tax rates'' as low as possible. Congress and the
Received from server -->president had the same thought in mind when they approved the 1986overhaul.
Received from server -->   A marginal rate is what you would pay on any additional dollars
Received from server -->you earned. For example, if you are married and have taxable incomeof $27,000, your top marginal rate is 15 percent; you are said to be
Received from server -->in the 15 percent bracket. Earn another $1 or $1,000 and it still is15 percent.
Received from server -->   But earn $3,000 more and your top rate jumps to 28 percent. Youwould pay 15 percent on the first $29,750 and 28 percent on the
Received from server -->excess _ that is, on $250. You have jumped into the 28 percentbracket.
Received from server -->   When Reagan took office, the top marginal rate was 70 percent.
Received from server -->Now, it is 33 percent, although backers of the overhaul like toclaim it is 28 percent.   Here's how that works:
Received from server -->   Remember that for a single person, for example, the first $17,850
Received from server -->of income subject to taxation is taxed at 15 percent. Any additionalincome between $17,850 and $43,150 is taxed at 28 percent. Anything
Received from server -->between $43,150 and $89,560 is taxed at 33 percent _ and then comesthe complication: The $89,560 upper limit is increased by $10,920
Received from server -->for each personal exemption claimed. Thus, a single person with a
Received from server -->dependent child pays 33 percent on taxable income between $43,150and $111,400.
Received from server -->   And finally, any additional dollars above the top limit are taxedat 28 percent.
Received from server -->   Why jump from a 28 percent rate to 33 percent and back to 28percent again? The answer is that congressional tax writers wanted
Received from server -->to have what appeared to be a top rate of 28 percent but did notlike the idea of having a person with $20,000 of taxable income pay
Received from server -->the same top rate as one with $2 million.   The solution was to deny wealthier Americans any benefit of the
Received from server -->bottom rate of 15 percent and any benefit from the personal
Received from server -->exemption. The net result was to impose a flat tax rate of about 28percent _ it can be more, depending on the number of exemptions _ on
Received from server -->every taxable dollar earned by these people.   As a side-effect, the well-to-do taxpayers who fall into this
Received from server -->category are facing a 33 percent marginal tax rate on some of theextra dollars they earn above the 28 percent bracket. For a single
Received from server -->person with no dependents, this surcharge applies on up to $57,330
Received from server -->of income _ that is, on everything between $43,150 and $100,480; fora couple with two children, the higher rate applies to $121,030 _
Received from server -->everything between $71,900 and $192,930.   The more children in the family, the more income that is taxed at
Received from server -->the 33 percent rate.</TEXT>

Received from server -->   For the second time in two years, Congress has
Received from server -->changed the rules for deducting interest on a home mortgage. Mosttaxpayers will find the new version more advantageous but they also
Received from server -->will be able to deduct less consumer interest.   In general, you may deduct interest on up to $1 million borrowedto buy, build or improve your principal home and second home and on
Received from server -->an additional $100,000 for a home-equity loan whose proceeds may beused for any purpose. But some conditions and definitions make therules considerably more complex.
Received from server -->   Under the 1986 tax overhaul, only 40 percent of interest paid in1988 on credit cards, auto loans, education loans and similarconsumer borrowing may be deducted. That is down from 65 percentallowed in 1987.
Received from server -->   There are similar restraints on investment interest, with anadded attraction: If your 1988 investment income was too low toallow you to deduct all your investment interest, you may be able to
Received from server -->carry it over and write it off in a future year.   But back to mortgage interest.
Received from server -->   If your outstanding mortgages were taken out before Oct. 14,1987, all the interest on one or two homes is deductible and the $1million limitation does not apply. Qualifying loans include money
Received from server -->borrowed to buy or improve a home, as well as home-equity loans,which usually are incurred after a person has lived in a home for a
Received from server -->while.   If you borrowed to buy, build, improve or refinance a home after
Received from server -->Oct. 13, 1987, the law draws a distinction between acquisition debtand home-equity debt.
Received from server -->   _ ACQUISITION DEBT: This is money borrowed to buy, build orsubstantially improve a first or second home. Interest on up to $1
Received from server -->million may be deducted, but that total is reduced by the amount ofany outstanding mortgage that was taken out before Oct. 14, 1987.
Received from server -->You must be able to prove that a loan was actually used for such
Received from server -->purpose; the Internal Revenue Service will accept as proof evidenceof acquisition costs incurred within 90 days before or after a loan
Received from server -->was closed.
Received from server -->   _ HOME-EQUITY DEBT: Interest on up to $100,000 of debt is fullydeductible even though the proceeds of the loan are used for
Received from server -->non-housing purposes; the loan must be secured by a mortgage on your
Received from server -->home. There is one catch: you may not deduct interest on moneyborrowed to make investments (such as municipal bonds) whose
Received from server -->interest is tax-exempt.
Received from server -->   The maximum deductible equity loan is the value of your homeminus any outstanding acquisition debt, or $100,000, whichever is
Received from server -->smaller.
Received from server -->   For purposes of a tax deduction, your principal home may be acooperative unit, condominium, houseboat or trailer. The second home
Received from server -->is a vacation home or other place that you may or may not rent outpart of the time; if it is rented out, you must use it at least 14
Received from server -->days a year or 10 percent of the number of days it is rented.
Received from server -->   If your mortgage interest payments for 1988 totaled $600 or more,the company or person holding the mortgage is required to send you a
Received from server -->Form 1098 by Jan. 31 showing how much interest you paid. The lenderalso sends a copy to the IRS.
Received from server -->   Mortgage points may be deducted if they are normally charged inyour area as a cost of getting a loan and if they are viewed as
Received from server -->interest _ not as service charges. They may be fully deductible in
Received from server -->the year paid only on loans to buy or improve your principal home.Otherwise, they must be written off gradually over the life of the
Received from server -->loan.   However, the Tax Court recently upheld the IRS position that
Received from server -->points paid to refinance a mortgage are not deductible.   To be deductible, points should be paid by separate check and not
Received from server -->simply withheld from the proceeds of the loan.   If your income and deductions are high enough, you may be subjectto the alternative minimum tax, a flat 21 percent levy, which coulddilute the value of your mortgage deduction.   Form 6251 and its instructions let you know if you are subject tothe minimum tax. Publication 545 spells out the rules for interest
Received from server -->deductions. Publication 936 gives the specifics on the mortgage
Received from server -->interest deduction.</TEXT></DOC>

Received from server --><TEXT>   Tax overhaul is making taxpayers _ or at leastfirst-time return filers _ of many younger Americans.
Received from server -->   The 1986 law, while lowering rates and raising exemptions, bars achild from taking any exemption if he or she can be claimed as adependent by a parent or someone else. In many cases it reduces the
Received from server -->standard deduction for dependents. And it requires any dependentwith interest, dividends or other unearned income totaling as little
Received from server -->as $501 to file a return.   Each personal exemption means a $1,950 reduction in 1988 income
Received from server -->subject to taxation. For most taxpayers, that is a saving of $292.50in taxes; for those in the 28 percent tax bracket, it is a saving ofup to $546.
Received from server -->   Five tests must be met for you to claim a person as your
Received from server -->dependent:   _ The dependent must be a resident or citizen of the UnitedStates or a resident of Canada or Mexico.   _ He or she must not have filed a joint return with a spouse.
Received from server -->   _ The dependent must be your child, grandchild, parent,grandparent, brother, sister, nephew, niece, uncle, aunt, son- ordaughter-in-law, parent-in-law, brother- or sister-in-law, or any
Received from server -->person who is a member of your household and lived with youthroughout the year.
Received from server -->   _ The dependent's gross income for 1988 must have been less than$1,950. This does not apply to your dependent child who either was
Received from server -->under 19 at the end of the year or was a full-time student.   _ You must have furnished more than half the dependent's support
Received from server -->during the year. (There are exceptions if you are divorced.) Support
Received from server -->includes foot, lodging, clothing, education, medical care,transportation, toys, pocket money, etc.   If all those conditions are met, you may take an exemption for a
Received from server -->dependent. But that dependent cannot take an exemption on his or herpersonal tax return _ even if you don't actually claim it.   So, how are your family's taxes affected if your 17-year-old
Received from server -->daughter had a part-time job and a small savings account last year?She earned $2,500 in the job and $200 interest.
Received from server -->   You, the parent, are allowed to claim her as a dependent. Forthat reason, and because her gross income exceeds $500, she must
Received from server -->file a return as well. Her standard deduction is her total earnedincome or $3,000 (the usual standard deduction for a single person),
Received from server -->whichever is smaller. Since her earned income _ wages, tips, fees
Received from server -->and the like _ was $2,500, that also is her standard deduction.   She should file the simplest form, 1040EZ. Only $200 of her
Received from server -->income would be taxable and her tax liability (from the tax table onpage 37 in the instructions) would be $32.
Received from server -->   In the unlikely event that your daughter had itemized deductions
Received from server -->exceeding $2,500, it would be to her advantage to itemize ratherthan take the standard deduction. She then would have to file Form
Received from server -->1040 and Schedule A, rather than 1040EZ.   If she had no unearned income _ such as interest and dividends _
Received from server -->she would not have to file a return unless her earned income
Received from server -->exceeded $3,000. But she should file to get a refund of any incometax that was withheld from her earnings.
Received from server -->   In any case, the standard deduction for a person who can beclaimed as a dependent of another may not exceed $500 of the
Received from server -->dependent's earned income _ whichever is greater.
Received from server -->   The real complications occur when your child is under 14 and hasunearned income of more than $1,000. In that case, some of the
Received from server -->child's income will be taxed at your, presumably higher, maximum tax
Received from server -->rate. You should read the instructions for Form 8615, which may haveto be attached to your child's return.
Received from server -->   This new provision is aimed at deterring the avoidance of tax bya parent's shifting of income-producing property to a child.
Received from server -->   Remember that you must list on your tax return the Social
Received from server -->Security number of any child age 5 or older whom you claim as adependent.

Received from server --><TEXT>   Once you determine that you must file a federal
Received from server -->tax return, the question is which form to use. The answer depends onyour income and marital status and whether you itemize deductions.   Use the simplest form _ the one-page Form 1040EZ _ if you are
Received from server -->single, you have no other dependents, you don't itemize and yourtaxable income (gross income minus any personal exemption) is less
Received from server -->than $50,000. Your income must have come solely from wages, tips ortaxable scholarships, except for up to $400 interest.
Received from server -->   The two-page 1040A is for any filing status (married, single,head of household), allows any number of exemptions but no itemized
Received from server -->deductions and is restricted to those whose taxable income is under
Received from server -->$50,000. But within that income limit you may have, in addition towages, tips and scholarships, any amount of interest, dividends and
Received from server -->unemployment compensation.   A 1040A filer must attach Schedule 1 if an Individual Retirement
Received from server -->Account deduction or child-care credit is claimed, or if dividendsor taxable interest exceed $400.
Received from server -->   The long Form 1040 is required for filers who don't qualify for a

Received from server --><TEXT>   Up to 10 million families are expected toreduce their 1988 tax bills by as much as $1,440 by claiming thecredit for dependent-care expenses.
Received from server -->   The credit generally is available to a taxpayer who, in order tofind or keep a job, pays another person to care for a child under 15
Received from server -->or other dependent. That dependent could be a disabled spouse; anydisabled person who could be claimed by the taxpayer as a dependent;
Received from server -->or a disabled person who had $1,950 or more in income and, thus,could not be claimed by another.   The hired person may not be your spouse, your child under the ageof 19 or any person you may claim as a dependent. In the case of a
Received from server -->couple, both spouses must work full time or part time to claim thecredit, unless one is a full-time student or is disabled.   The credit applies to amounts paid for household services and
Received from server -->care of the dependent while the taxpayer works or looks for work.These can include services of a cook, babysitter or housekeeper in
Received from server -->the home, as well as costs of outside care for a child under 15, but
Received from server -->not costs of overnight camp. Outside care for a disabled dependentof any age also is covered if that person regularly spends at least
Received from server -->eight hours a day in your home.   Special rules apply to children of divorced or separated parents.   There are these limitations on the credit:
Received from server -->   _ The total of claimed dependent-care expenses may not exceed
Received from server -->your earned income (wages, fees, tips and the like) or, in the caseof a couple, the earnings of the lower-paid spouse.
Received from server -->   _ The maximum claimed expenses are $2,400 for one dependent and$4,800 for two or more.   _ The credit is for 30 percent of eligible expenses if youradjusted gross income is $10,000 or less. It drops one percentagepoint for each $2,000 of income; the credit is 20 percent for income
Received from server -->above $28,000.   Taxpayers who file the long Form 1040 must also fill out Form
Received from server -->2441 to claim the credit. Filers of 1040A must attach Schedule 1.   Claiming the child-care credit can bring these complications:   _ If you pay $50 or more in a calendar quarter to someone who
Received from server -->cares for your dependent, you generally must pay Social Security taxof 7.51 percent on those wages, withhold another 7.51 percent from
Received from server -->the worker's wages and forward the full 15.02 percent each quarterby filing Form 942.
Received from server -->   _ Paying wages of $1,000 or more in a quarter may also subjectyou to paying unemployment taxes. Get Form 940 for details.
Received from server -->   _ You may have to calculate whether you are subject to thealternative minimum tax. This is a flat 21 percent tax that you payonly if it exceeds your regular income tax; it is aimed at
Received from server -->preventing well-to-do people from totally avoiding taxes through useof large deductions.

Received from server --><TEXT>   It's easy to avoid the most common error foundon federal tax returns: Just be sure to claim the right standarddeduction.
Received from server -->   Every year the experts sample returns on which errors have beenfound, and every year the results are the same: Thousands of
Received from server -->taxpayers who don't itemize deductions write down the wrong standarddeduction.   The problem was made worse by the 1986 tax overhaul, which
Received from server -->limited the standard deduction for taxpayers _ mostly students _ whocan be claimed as a dependent by someone else. The new law also
Received from server -->complicated the standard deduction for those who are blind or atleast 65.
Received from server -->   If you file the long Form 1040, get your standard deduction frompage 17 of the instructions. See pages 28 and 29 if you file 1040A
Received from server -->or 1040EZ.   Thousands of other taxpayers make errors in arithmetic, and
Received from server -->although such mistakes usually are caught by an IRS computer, theylikely will delay any refund.
Received from server -->   Another common error can be most costly. Large numbers oflower-income working families that are eligible for the
Received from server -->earned-income credit fail to claim it; others make the wrongcalculations. To determine whether you are eligible, check the
Received from server -->worksheet on page 20 of the 1040 instructions or page 35 of the1040A instructions.
Received from server -->   Some other things to remember:</TEXT>
Received from server --><TEXT>   _ Be sure you copy the right figure when you read across the tax
Received from server -->tables to find your tax liability.   _ Even the rule for rounding off to whole dollars has been
Received from server -->complicated. The IRS says, for example that you may round off $1.39to $1, and $2.50 to $3. But if you have to add two or more figures
Received from server -->to arrive at the amount to enter on a line, round off only the total_ not the individual figures.
Received from server -->   _ If you had two or more employers and earned more than $45,000last year, you may have had too much Social Security tax withheld
Received from server -->from your paychecks. The excess may be subtracted from income taxesowed.   _ Tax on your Series E or EE U.S. savings bonds is due no later
Received from server -->than when they are redeemed. However, you may choose to report the
Received from server -->interest each year when it accrues and pay tax annually.   _ The law says you have not filed a return unless it is signed.
Received from server -->You could face a $500 penalty for filing a return that does not
Received from server -->include basic information necessary to determine your tax liability.And even if you feel the need to protest, don't cross out or alterthe ``under penalties of perjury'' declaration just above the
Received from server -->signature line; that would void the return.   _ Keep all records pertaining to your taxes for at least three
Received from server -->years. Records on the sale, purchase or improvement of property,including your home, should be kept permanently, as should paperwork
Received from server -->on your Individual Retirement Account.   _ You must file Schedule B (for Form 1040) or Schedule 1 (for
Received from server -->1040A) if you received taxable interest or dividends exceeding $400.   _ The IRS needs to know how much tax-exempt interest you received
Received from server -->last year; it should be listed on line 8b. Don't include interestearned on your Individual Retirement Account.
Received from server -->   _ By Feb. 15 you should receive from your employer a W-2 formshowing your 1988 income. If you don't, ask for it. Lack of a W-2
Received from server -->does not excuse you from filing and paying any due tax by the April17 deadline.
Received from server -->   _ If you cannot complete your return by the deadline, file a Form4868 instead, which gives you an automatic extension to Aug. 15.
Received from server -->However, you must estimate how much tax you owe and send a check forthat amount with Form 4868.
Received from server -->   _ The sequence numbers listed under ``1988'' in the upper right
Received from server -->corner of your tax forms tell you in what order the supplementalforms and schedules should be attached to your 1040.
Received from server -->   _ You may have heard that if you use the preprinted stick-onlabel on your return, you are making it easier for the IRS to selectyour return for an audit. Nonsense, say experts outside the IRS; the
Received from server -->label simply makes it easier for your return to be processed througha computer.
Received from server -->   _ If you are self-employed, you may deduct on line 6 of Form 1040
Received from server -->25 percent of what you paid for health insurance for yourself andyour family. The deduction may not exceed your net self-employment
Received from server -->income, and you don't get it if you are covered by an employer'shealth insurance.
Received from server -->   _ Investors in enterprises that generate losses may be subject toa whole new set of tax rules. In general, a loss from a passive
Received from server -->activity (something in which you do not materially participate) maynot be used to avoid taxes on non-passive income, such as wages.
Received from server -->Check IRS Publication 925.   _ If you deduct alimony payments, your return must show the
Received from server -->Social Security number of the recipient; the recipient's return mustshow your number.   _ Don't forget to put a stamp on your envelope; it isn't a filed
Received from server -->return until it is received by the IRS, and the Postal Serviceprobably will not send it without a stamp.

Received from server --><TEXT>   Recent tax laws have cut deeply into deductions
Received from server -->traditionally claimed by millions of taxpayers. Many writeoffs havebeen lost entirely because of higher thresholds on deductions for
Received from server -->medical and miscellaneous expenses.   But there still are enough deductions left to make it worthwhilefor one-third of taxpayers to itemize.
Received from server -->   One of the most expensive changes for individuals in the 1986 tax
Received from server -->overhaul was repeal of the deduction for state and local salestaxes. But state and local income and property taxes are still
Received from server -->deductible.
Received from server -->   Only unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 7{ percent ofadjusted gross income may be deducted. Certain uninsurednon-business casualty losses, such as from fires, may be deducted
Received from server -->subject to a 10 percent threshold.   There is a 2 percent limit on miscellaneous deductions that
Received from server -->applies to such things as unreimbursed employee expenses, includingunion dues, tools, work clothes (but not if suitable for street
Received from server -->wear), protective safety shoes and glasses; investment expenses,such as advice, subscriptions and rental of safe deposit boxes in
Received from server -->which investment-related papers are stored, and tax-preparation fees.   1988 is the last year to deduct, subject to the 2 percent rule, a
Received from server -->portion of the basic monthly home telephone service charge as anexpense of producing income.   Very few miscellaneous expenses may be deducted without regard to
Received from server -->the 2 percent threshold. These include certain work-related expensesof handicapped people and gambling losses up to the amount of
Received from server -->gambling winnings.   Some other deductions:
Received from server -->   _ If you use your own car for the benefit of a tax-exemptcharity, including driving to and from the organization, you may
Received from server -->deduct 12 cents a mile or the cost of gas and oil, plus (in eithercase) parking fees and tolls.
Received from server -->   _ On the other hand, driving your child to the hospital gets youa medical-expense deduction of only 9 cents a mile (or gas and oil)
Received from server -->plus parking and tolls. These transportation expenses are lumped inwith other reimbursed medical expenses and subject to the 7{ percentthreshold.
Received from server -->   Over the years, the definition of medical expenses has beenexpanded. In addition to such traditional costs as physicians' anddentists' fees and prescription drugs, the term can include a hair
Received from server -->transplant, drug-abuse treatment, a closed-caption television device
Received from server -->for the deaf, a facelift, or even musical lessons prescribed tocorrect an overbite.   _ Use Form 1040 line 28 to report penalties paid for early
Received from server -->withdrawal of savings; you won't be taxed on that amount.
Received from server -->   _ If you itemize, you may be able to write off certain expensesincurred in connection with a job-related move if the new job is atleast 35 miles farther from your old home than was the old job. (For
Received from server -->example, if your old job was three miles from home, you new job mustbe at least 38 miles from the old home.) If you had no previous job,
Received from server -->the new job must be 35 miles or more from your old home. Publication521, free from the IRS, gives details.
Received from server -->   _ Use Form 8283 to report gifts other than money to charity whenthe value exceeds $500. No breakdown is required on your return ifsuch gifts are $500 or less, but you would be wise to keep records.
Received from server -->In general, you are allowed a deduction for contributions of moneyor ordinary-income property (as opposed to property that could
Received from server -->produce a capital gain) up to 30 percent of your adjusted grossincome.
Received from server -->   _ Non-business losses due to fire, theft, storm and similarevents may be deductible; misplacing or breaking a valuable item is
Received from server -->not a deductible loss. After absorbing the first $100 of each loss,you may deduct only the total amount of all losses in a year thatexceed 10 percent of adjusted gross income. See Form 4684.
Received from server -->   Here are some expenses that are not deductible: scientology fees,funeral expenses, health club dues, the value of your services
Received from server -->donated to charity, fines, termite or moth damage, over-the-counter
Received from server -->drugs even if prescribed, diaper service, gifts to foreigncharities, child support, and costs of commuting from home to work.

Received from server -->   There's a new twist in the tax law for sportsfans who give to the ol' alma mater.
Received from server -->   Even if your gift to a college or university entitles you to buyseason tickets, you still may take a charitable deduction for 80
Received from server -->percent of your donation.   This new law, enacted last year, overturns a 1983 ruling by the
Received from server -->Internal Revenue Service.   The IRS noted that in many cases, games are sold out long in
Received from server -->advance, and the only way to be assured of getting a ticket is tomake a donation to the college or its athletic programs. Therefore,
Received from server -->the IRS insisted, the privilege of buying a ticket had value, and a
Received from server -->charitable deduction is prohibited when the donor receives somethingof value in return.
Received from server -->   Lawmakers would have none of that. So, under a 1988 law, you maydeduct 80 percent of such contributions if, as part of the
Received from server -->arrangemnt, you receive the right to purchase tickets. If youreceive no such right, the contribution is 100 percent deductible.
Received from server -->If you receive tickets as part of the deal, none of the contributionmay be deducted.
Received from server -->   The new law applies retroactively to contributions given after
Received from server -->Dec. 31, 1983.</TEXT></DOC>

Received from server --><TEXT>   Capital gains are an aspect of tax law that
Received from server -->most people encounter only in connection with the sale of theirhome. But in many cases, taxation on profits from a home sale is
Received from server -->deferred or avoided entirely.   In general, the law treats such gains in much the same way thatit treats profits from the sale of stock, land, coins or other
Received from server -->property. That means any profit is taxable income, and under the newlaw, there is no automatic exclusion of a portion of capital gains.   However, there are two ``outs'' when the capital gain is from the
Received from server -->sale of your principal home:   _ First, if certain conditions are met, any tax on the gain is
Received from server -->deferred so long as you buy a replacement home that costs at leastas much as your old home sold for. The replacement must be boughtwithin 24 months before or 24 months after the old one is sold.
Received from server -->   If your new one costs less than the ``adjusted'' selling price ofyour old home, you pay tax on the profit from the sale or on theportion of the sales price that exceeds the cost of the new home _
Received from server -->whichever is less. You reduce the tax bite by adjusting the salesprice of the old home to reflect points, fix-up expenses, realestate commissions and legal fees you paid.
Received from server -->   Deferral of gain on your home sale is not optional _ you must doit anytime you buy a principal home whose price equals or exceeds
Received from server -->the adjusted sales price of your old one.   _ Second, if you or your spouse are 55 or older, you may avoidtax on the first $125,000 of profits. This option is available only
Received from server -->once in a lifetime. To qualify, the property must have been yourprincipal home for at least three of the last five years before thesale.
Received from server -->   The miscellaneous tax bill that Congress passed last October madetwo minor changes affecting these provisions.
Received from server -->   One ensures that a couple will not be denied the benefits of thedeferral because one spouse dies after the old home is sold butbefore the new one is bought.
Received from server -->   The second stipulates that a person 55 or older who becomesmentally or physically incapable of self-care during the five-yearperiod preceding the home sale will be deemed to have met the
Received from server -->residency requirement if up to four of the five years are spent in anursing home.   If you sold a principal home in 1988, you should check
Received from server -->Publication 523, which is free from the IRS. Whether you purchased areplacement home or claimed the special benefit for those 55 or
Received from server -->older, you probably will have to file a form 2119.   Any gain that is taxable must be reported on 1040 Schedule D.   Did you sell your home in 1988 and won't receive some of the

Received from server --><TEXT>
Received from server -->   The government said today that it was looking at apossible bid for the electronics giant General Electric Co. PLC that
Received from server -->an international consortium is expected to launch within days.
Received from server -->   The takeover, which analysts say could be worth between $11.5billion and $14.2 billion, would be the largest in Britain.
Received from server -->   The consortium is expected to include Plessey PLC, anotherelectronics company which is the target of a $3 billion hostile
Received from server -->takeover bid from GEC and Siemens AG of West Germany, anotherelectronics company.
Received from server -->   Although no bid for GEC has been formally launched, the Office of
Received from server -->Fair Trading has legal powers to look at a bid ``in contemplation.''   ``We really are looking at the situation to see who the
Received from server -->participants are involved before we can take real active steps,''
Received from server -->said a spokesman for the office, who asked not to be identified.``There hasn't actually been a statement of intention.''
Received from server -->   The Office of Fair Trading usually reviews a bid and then makes a
Received from server -->recommendation to the trade secretary on whether he should refer itto the monopolies commission for a full investigation.
Received from server -->   The bid speculation prompted heavy trading in GEC on London's
Received from server -->Stock Exchange by midday Monday.   A GEC spokesman, who wasn't identified in accordance with British
Received from server -->practice, called the developments vague and inconclusive but saidthat a takeover would be fought.
Received from server -->   ``This appears to be a self-interested attempt by the board of
Received from server -->Plessey and its advisers to form a consortium to break up GEC andtherefore save Plessey,'' he said.
Received from server -->   The possible bid for GEC began to be taken seriously after theinvestment firm Lazard Brothers and Co. said over the weekend that
Received from server -->it had helped form a company called Metsun Ltd. to devise a proposal
Received from server -->``which may or may not'' lead to an offer for GEC.   Metsun is headed by Sir John Cuckney, chairman of helicopter

Received from server --><TEXT>   President Reagan today sent Congress a $1.15trillion farewell budget that attacked his biggest economic failure,
Received from server -->the federal deficit, by offering up again some of his cherished
Received from server -->ideas about reducing the size of government.   The president's ninth and final spending plan _ out of balance
Received from server -->like all of his others _ is largely an academic exercise, certain to
Received from server -->be overhauled to reflect the priorities of a Democratic-controlled
Received from server -->Congress and an incoming president, George Bush, after hisinauguration Jan. 20.
Received from server -->   Bush aides said that the president-elect agreed with the generalthrust of the Reagan document, especially the absence of any new
Received from server -->taxes, but still intended to submit his own recommendations aftertaking office.
Received from server -->   If Reagan's ideas were adopted in their entirety, the deficit
Received from server -->would fall to $92.5 billion in the 1990 fiscal year, the lowestsince 1981 when he took office.
Received from server -->   ``This budget shows that a gradual elimination of the deficit ispossible without raising taxes,'' Reagan said in his budget message.
Received from server -->``It can be done in a reasonable, responsible way _ with discipline
Received from server -->and fairness. New taxes are not required.''
Received from server -->   In his proposals for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, 1989,Reagan advocated terminating a total of 82 government programs,
Received from server -->slashing spending on farm programs by $9.7 billion and trimming thegrowth in Medicare and Medicaid, the giant health programs, by about$5 billion. The Pentagon's budget, on the other hand, was awarded a
Received from server -->big spending increase.   The budget would provide increased spending for two of the
Received from server -->government's most pressing new problems, bailing out hundreds ofinsolvent savings and loan institutions and cleaning up contaminatednuclear weapons plants. AIDS research and space exploration would
Received from server -->also receive increases.   While Reagan was presenting his budget only 11 days before
Received from server -->leaving office, many of its broad outlines were expected to beadopted by Bush, who has said he will unveil his own proposals to a
Received from server -->special joint session of Congress soon after taking office.   In two key respects, the two budgets will be alike. Both menpledged to cut the deficit, which is projected to climb this year to
Received from server -->$161.5 billion, without resorting to new taxes and without touchingSocial Security.
Received from server -->   But Bush is expected to seek a smaller increase in defensespending while allocating more money in such areas as child care,cleaning up the environment and housing the homeless.
Received from server -->   Skeptical Democrats believe Bush will find it impossible tofulfill all his campaign promises for higher spending while relying
Received from server -->on a ``flexible freeze'' on other government programs to eliminatethe budget deficit without resorting to new taxes.   ``President Reagan's final budget is really irrelevant at this
Received from server -->point,'' Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., former chairman of the HouseBudget Committee, said today on ``CBS This Morning.'' ``It is a
Received from server -->farewell gesture that every president is required to do. It onlybecomes relevant if George Bush today, tomorrow or this week says,
Received from server -->`that's my budget.' I don't expect him to do that.'' Senate MajorityLeader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called Reagan's proposal ``amiablefiction.''
Received from server -->   Reagan will leave office with a budget that proposes collecting$1.059 trillion in revenues and spending $1.152 trillion, leaving a
Received from server -->budget deficit of $92.5 billion.   The deficit, if realized, would be the lowest since a $73.7billion imbalance between spending and revenues in 1981, the year
Received from server -->Reagan took office with a pledge to balance the budget by 1984.Reagan saw that promise swamped by a tide of red ink which hasalmost tripled the national debt.
Received from server -->   In his budget message, Reagan blamed the huge deficits on thesevere 1981-82 recession, which reduced government revenues, and on
Received from server -->the refusal of Congress to go along with his spending cuts. But hepredicted that the deficit could be totally eliminated by 1993 ifCongress adopts his spending cuts. Similar predictions of future
Received from server -->budget deficits in past Reagan budgets have proved to be wildlyoptimistic, however.
Received from server -->   ``We have an opportunity this year to put the worst of thedeficit problem behind us and enable the next administration tobegin its term of office with a clean slate,'' Reagan said.
Received from server -->   Reagan's $92.5 billion deficit target for 1990 would be wellwithin the Gramm-Rudman requirement which sets a $100 billiondeficit goal for 1990. This law establishes declining deficit
Received from server -->targets leading to a balanced budget in 1993, holding out the threatof across-the-board spending cuts if the targets are not met.
Received from server -->   Many private economists believe Reagan's 1990 deficit estimate isbased on overly optimistic assessments about how the economy willperform, including expectations that growth will continue at a rapid
Received from server -->clip while inflation and interest rates both decline.   Among the 82 individual programs recommended for termination by
Received from server -->Reagan are the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Legal ServicesCorporation, the Economic Development Administration, the
Received from server -->Appalachian Regional Commission, direct loans by the Small BusinessAdministration, Amtrak railroad passenger subsidies, mass transitgrants and subsidies to airlines serving small airports.
Received from server -->   Reagan has tried and failed over the years to get Congress to goalong with these proposals.
Received from server -->   The president's final budget protects his defense buildup, one ofthe hallmarks of his presidency, by proposing a 5.4 percent increaseto $315.2 billion in spending authority, 2 percent higher than the
Received from server -->expected rate of inflation. As part of the increase, the budgetseeks a 44 percent increase in spending authority for development of
Received from server -->the spaced-based Star Wars nuclear defense shield.   Spending authority reflects not only the checks that will bewritten in a given year but also authorization for outlays on
Received from server -->weapons systems that are begun in one year but paid for in futureyears. Defense outlays for 1990 are projected at $303 billion,
Received from server -->compared to estimated outlays of $298.3 billion in 1989.   The president also proposes making a downpayment of $900 million
Received from server -->to start cleaning up and modernizing the government's aging nuclear
Received from server -->weapons facilities, a project that the Energy Department estimatescould cost as much as $128 billion over the next two decades.
Received from server -->   Likewise, the budget projects spending $16 billion this year and$9 billion next year to bail out hundreds of insolvent savings and
Received from server -->loan institutions. From 1988 through 1994, Reagan's budget estimatesspending to mop up the S&amp;L mess will exceed $80 billion but leavesthe problem of finding the necessary funds to the incoming Bush
Received from server -->administration.   In the area of cuts, Reagan's budget proposed trimming the hugeMedicare program, which provides health care to Social Security
Received from server -->recipients, by $3.2 billion below the projected increase for 1990,primarily by reducing the fees received by doctors and hospitals.
Received from server -->   Medicaid, which pays the health bills of poor people, would becut by $1.7 billion over its projected increase for 1990 with thesavings coming from reductions in federal payments to the states,
Received from server -->which run the Medicaid program.</TEXT>

Received from server --><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today refused to let the
Received from server -->government permit Japanese salmon fishermen off the Alaska coastfrom using huge nets in which porpoise and other marine mammals gettrapped.
Received from server -->   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals courtruling that blocked such fishing.
Received from server -->   At issue is an interpretation of a federal law, the Marine Mammal
Received from server -->Protection Act of 1972, which spells out how marine mammals may be``taken'' _ hunted, captured or killed _ in U.S. waters.   The law generally bans all such takings of marine mammals but
Received from server -->contains an exception allowing the secretary of commerce to
Received from server -->authorize specified takings incidental to commercial fishing.   The secretary, however, may not allow incidental takings of any
Received from server -->marine mammal species in danger of significant depletion orextinction.   The United States requires fishing permits within a 200-mile
Received from server -->protected zone.   In 1986, the Federation of Japan Salmon Fisheries Cooperative
Received from server -->Associations sought to extend a permit under which it would beentitled to snare up to 5,500 Dall's porpoise a year in salmongillnets cast in the waters of the north Pacific Ocean and the
Received from server -->Bering Sea.
Received from server -->   Other sea mammals such as Northern fur seals and sea lions alsobecome snarled in the nets, some of which are nine miles long.
Received from server -->   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity issued a general permit forthe Japanese fishermen to operate after finding that the Dall'sporpoise population would not be threatened.
Received from server -->   He could not make such a determination, however, for the Northern
Received from server -->fur seal or Northern sea lion populations.
Received from server -->   Environmental and Native Alaskan groups challenged the legalityof granting a permit to the Japanese fishermen.   A federal trial judge blocked the fishing operations during the
Received from server -->salmon season last June and July. The judge said the governmentcould not assure that some marine mammals surely to be caught in thenets are not in danger of depletion or extinction.
Received from server -->   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here upheld the injunction by a2-1 vote, and the Supreme Court rejected the Reagan adminstration'semergency challenge of that ruling last June 9.   In the appeal acted on today, Justice Department lawyers arguedthat the practical effect of the appeals court's Feb. 16 ruling
Received from server -->``would be to shut down large segments of commercial fishing by bothdomestic and foreign entities in U.S. waters.''
Received from server -->   But lawyers for the environmental and Native Alaskan groups urgedthe justices to reject the appeal.
Received from server -->   Lawyers for the Center for Environmental Education contended thatMarine Mammal Protection Act amendments enacted last Novemberindicate that Congress agreed with the appeals court's
Received from server -->interpretation of the law.
Received from server -->   ``Congress ... intentionally drafted the (amendments) so as toexclude the Japanese driftnet fleet and reauthorized the
Received from server -->prohibitions in the (act) in their existing form,'' they argued.   The case is Verity vs. Center for Environmental Education, 88-428.</TEXT>

Received from server -->   The Supreme Court today barred Texas officials
Received from server -->from requiring cabooses or alternative safety equipment on mosttrains traveling through the state.   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that federal law
Received from server -->preempts such state regulation.   The Texas Railroad Commission in 1986 adopted a rule requiring
Received from server -->cabooses capable of communicating with the locomotive on all trainscarrying various hazardous materials and on trains more than 2,000feet long that lack mechanical devices for monitoring the train and
Received from server -->track.   The regulation was designed to allow someone in the caboose to
Received from server -->make sure brakes, axles and wheels are not overheating and to checkfor any problems behind the train.   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the rule last
Received from server -->July. The appeals court, noting the safety aspects of caboosesgenerally have been supplanted by technological advances, said theFederal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 preempts the state's regulation.
Received from server -->   Cabooses once were essential to train operation in the days when
Received from server -->brakes were located there, the appeals court said.
Received from server -->   But now, it said, ``Automatic brakes are controlled from the
Received from server -->locomotive, advances in wheel bearings decrease the risk ofoverheating and monitoring devices simulate rear-car observation.''
Received from server -->   Major railroads, through collective bargaining with their unions,
Received from server -->in 1982 eliminated cabooses from about one-fourth of all trains.
Received from server -->   The 5th Circuit court said Congress, in passing the FederalRailroad Safety Act, determined that cabooses do not involve safety.
Received from server -->The issue is one for collective bargaining, the appeals court said.   ``Under these circumstances, we are compelled to conclude thatthe (act) has impliedly preempted state regulation of cabooses,''
Received from server -->the appeals court said. Requiring cabooses in some states wouldburden interstate commerce by forcing the railroads to attach
Received from server -->cabooses at all times or stop at state borders where they arerequired to attach them, the appeals court said.   Texas regulation permits railroads to avoid the need for cabooses
Received from server -->by installing load and overheating detectors and other devices alongthe track.
Received from server -->   But the appeals court said the requirement for those devices is
Received from server -->preempted by federal law as well.   The Texas Railroad Commission said the 5th Circuit court ruling
Received from server -->permits ``collective bargaining to override governmental regulationof a safety issue.''   The case is Railroad Commission of Texas vs. Missouri Pacific,88-789.</TEXT>

Received from server --><TEXT>   British electronics giant General Electric Co. PLCon Monday accused rival Plessey Co. of mounting ``a spoiling
Received from server -->tactic'' by joining an international consortium that is expected tomake a hostile bid for GEC.   GEC had joined Siemens AG of West Germany in launching a hostile,
Received from server -->$3 billion offer for Plessey in November. Now GEC finds itself the
Received from server -->target of a possible counter-bid by a consortium that probably will
Received from server -->include Plessey.   GEC said it would fight the possible counter-bid and pursue itsefforts with Siemens to take over Plessey.
Received from server -->   Britain's GEC and U.S.-based General Electric Co. are not related.   The government's Office of Fair Trading said it was studying the
Received from server -->possible bid for GEC, which is expected to be launched by a new
Received from server -->international consortium within days.   That takeover could be worth between $11.5 billion and $14.2
Received from server -->billion, Britain's largest ever.
Received from server -->   A counter-bid is known on Wall Street as the Pac Man takeoverdefense because of its similarity to the eat-or-be-eaten video game.   The possibility of GEC being taken over sparked political
Received from server -->controversy at the prospect of a large defense-oriented companyfalling under foreign control.   Three years ago, two Cabinet ministers resigned in a controversyover foreign bids for Britain's only helicopter maker, Westland PLC.
Received from server -->   GEC said a weekend statement from the investment firm LazardBrothers &amp; Co. about a possible takeover bid for GEC was ``vague and
Received from server -->inconclusive.''
Received from server -->   A GEC spokesman told Press Association, the domestic news agency:``This appears to be a self-interested attempt by the board of
Received from server -->Plessey and its advisers to form a consortium to break up GEC andtherefore save Plessey, in the short term, regardless of the cost toBritish industry in terms of lost opportunities and lost jobs.''   The spokesman said it was a ``spoiling tactic'' by Plessey thatwould be fought.
Received from server -->   GEC Managing Director Lord Weinstock said in a Sunday televisioninterview that GEC would pursue its bid for Plessey.   A GEC spokesman declined to comment to The Associated Press.Plessey also had no comment, a spokesman told the AP.
Received from server -->   GEC shares jumped 19 pence (34 cents) to finish at 221 pence
Received from server -->($3.91) in heavy trading on London's Stock Exchange Monday. Plesseyshares were down 2 pence (4 cents) at 226 pence ($4) at the close.   The possible bid for GEC began to look serious after LazardBrothers said it had helped form a company called Metsun Ltd. todevise a proposal ``which may or may not'' lead to an offer for GEC.   Metsun is headed by Sir John Cuckney, Westland's chairman.   Metsun was talking to possible international partners, Lazard
Received from server -->Brothers said, without identifying them. British news reports saidpossible participants might include Thomson-CSF of France, AmericanTelephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and General Electric of the United States.
Received from server -->   Meanwhile, Barclays Bank PLC confirmed it was putting together a
Received from server -->$6.2 billion syndicated loan to help finance such a bid.   The Office of Fair Trading said it was looking at the possiblebid, noting that it has legal powers to review a bid ``incontemplation.''
Received from server -->   A spokesman who requested anonymity said the office was examiningwhich participants were involved, adding: ``There hasn't actually
Received from server -->been a statement of intention.''
Received from server -->   The Office of Fair Trading usually reviews a bid and then makes a
Received from server -->recommendation to the trade secretary on whether to refer it to the
Received from server -->monopolies commission for full investigation.   Rhe acquisition of a stake in Westland by United Technologies
Received from server -->Corp.'s Sikorsky division over rival European bidders plunged thegovernment into controversy in 1986.   Michael Heseltine, who resigned as defense secretary inopposition to the American bid for Westland, spearheaded demands
Received from server -->from politicians and unions for Trade Secretary Lord Young to referthe GEC matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission ``withoutdelay.''
Received from server -->   After the Office of Fair Trading made its statement, Heseltine
Received from server -->said: ``I believe the Government is to be congratulated on the speedwith which it has acted to give a proper appraisal of the strategic
Received from server -->and industrial implications of a breakup of GEC.''
Received from server -->   The opposition Labor Party says it will raise the issue in the
Received from server -->House of Commons ``as a matter of the utmost urgency'' when
Received from server -->lawmakers return from the Christmas recess on Tuesday.

Received from server -->   In a major victory for Dow Chemical Co., theSupreme Court on Monday upheld a lower court ruling dismissing
Received from server -->hundreds of personal injury lawsuits tied to the chemical giant's
Received from server -->anti-nausea drug Bendectin.   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by more than 800families who filed a federal lawsuit against Merrell DowPharmaceuticals, the Cincinnati-based Dow unit that manufactures thedrug.   Meanwhile Monday, the justices agreed to decide whether Congress
Received from server -->may outlaw all sexually explicit telephone dial-up message services,known as dial-a-porn. The high court will rule on the validity of a
Received from server -->1988 law that sought to ban all obscene and indecent messages
Received from server -->available through these services.   A federal judge in California ruled last summer that the law
Received from server -->could be applied to ban all obscene messages, but he struck down the
Received from server -->law's ban on messages deemed merely indecent.
Received from server -->   The court also made several decisions effecting state and localgovernments, including one that bars cities and towns from receiving
Received from server -->$180 million in federal revenue-sharing funds withheld by the Reagan
Received from server -->administration. In the case involving the Dow Chemical subsidiary,
Received from server -->the justices refused to revive lawsuits seeking millions of dollarsin damages on behalf of children with birth defects allegedly causedby their mothers' use of Bendectin during pregnancy.
Received from server -->   Merrell Dow had agreed in a 1984 settlement to create a $120
Received from server -->million fund to compensate these children, although it did not admitthe drug had caused the defects.
Received from server -->   The settlement later was rejected by a federal appeals court,which reinstated the suits against Merrell Dow. A federal jurydecided after a 22-day trial in 1985 that Bendectin did not causebirth defects when taken in prescribed doses.
Received from server -->   That ruling was appealed, and last August it was upheld by the6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Received from server -->   Merrell Dow spokesman William Donaldson said his company was``pleased with the U.S. Supreme Court's denial of a hearing since
Received from server -->this case is the major case involving Bendectin.'' The company
Received from server -->maintains the drug is safe.   In other business-related action Monday, the Supreme Court:   _Left intact a ruling that $180 million in federalrevenue-sharing funds properly was withheld from local governmentsunder budget cuts imposed by the so-called Gramm-Rudman Act.
Received from server -->   _Agreed to decide whether federal courts should referee somedisputes over electric power rates between public utilities and

Received from server -->there is no cost-related reason.
Received from server -->   _Agreed to decide whether states generally are immune from being
Received from server -->sued for money damages by bankruptcy trustees.   _Refused to let the government permit Japanese salmon fishermen
Received from server -->off the Alaska coast to use huge nets in which porpoise and othermarine mammals get trapped.
Received from server -->   _Agreed to decide whether the Justice Department must supply a

Received from server -->that sued four Venezuelans and a U.S. citizen living in Venezuela.   The company, Newman-Green Inc., has been making aerosol valves
Received from server -->for more than 30 years. It arranged in the early 1970s to market thevalves in Venezuela and set up a licensing agreement with five
Received from server -->shareholders of the venture in the South American country.   Newman-Green filed a suit in federal court in Illinois in 1982,accusing the five of violating the royalty agreement.   The five include William L. Bettison, a U.S. citizen who lives in
Received from server -->Venezuela.
Received from server -->   A federal judge awarded Newman-Green $200,000 in unpaid royaltiesbut said the Venezuelan shareholders did not owe royalties for a
Received from server -->period after the U.S. company canceled its license with theVenezuelan shareholders.   Newman-Green asked a three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit
Received from server -->Court of Appeals for increased royalties.   The panel then noticed that the federal courts appeared to lackauthority over the dispute because of the presence of Bettison as a

Received from server --><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Reagan administration on Monday dumped thesavings and loan crisis into the lap of President-elect Bush,acknowledging for the first time it does not have enough money to
Received from server -->bail out the troubled industry.
Received from server -->   The administration, in its proposed budget for fiscal year 1990,
Received from server -->outlined plans to spend $64 billion from the Federal Savings andLoan Insurance Corp., from 1989 through 1994. Of that, $16 billion
Received from server -->would be spent in fiscal 1989, which began last Oct. 1; $9 billionin 1990, and $39 billion from 1991 through 1994.
Received from server -->   But the budget document acknowledged ``these proposals will notresolve the entire problem.'' It said Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Received from server -->Brady is working on a plan, ``including identifying additional
Received from server -->funding sources for FSLIC,'' to be presented to Bush within 60 days.
Received from server -->   The budget shows spending of $64 billion over six years, but
Received from server -->projects collections by the FSLIC of only $33.4 billion. That doesnot necessarily mean, however, the $30.6 billion difference will
Received from server -->have to be made up with tax dollars immediately.   The insurance fund, which guarantees deposit accounts up to$100,000, can continue, as it has over the past year, to spend inthe form of promissory notes to bailed-out institutions.
Received from server -->   The notes count as immediate spending for budget purposes but,
Received from server -->until they come due sometimes 10 years later, the agency spends onlyenough cash to cover the interest.
Received from server -->   Another kind of commitment from S&amp;L regulators _ promises to makegood on some of the future losses of rescued institutions _ do notshow up on the budget at all until the cash is actually spent.
Received from server -->   In calendar year 1988, S&amp;L regulators spent, or promised tospend, more than $38 billion to rescue a post-Depression record 217
Received from server -->insolvent savings and loans. However, that still leaves a largeproblem _ about 350 insolvent institutions and another 150 with
Received from server -->capital levels close to insolvency.
Received from server -->   The Reagan budget document maintains that of the $25 billion inprojected spending for 1989 and 1990, $10 billion in 1989 and $5
Received from server -->billion in 1990 will be for ``new case resolutions'' and the rest topay for old rescue deals.   However, Reagan budget director, Joseph R. Wright Jr.,acknowledged most of the $10 billion for new deals in 1989 was

Received from server -->solution,'' Wright said. Any additional money should be linked to
Received from server -->reforms of the regulatory system, he said.
Received from server -->   ``If you just pour money into it and leave the industry operatingthe way it is now, you can find yourself pouring it in again ineight to 10 years,'' he warned.
Received from server -->   An official of the General Accounting Office, the auditing wingof Congress, said regulators appear to have already committedthemselves to spending all of their projected revenue for the next
Received from server -->decade.   ``Based on what I've seen, I think they've spent it all, or maybeeven more than they can count on receiving over the next 10 years,''
Received from server -->said Craig Simmons, a GA analyst.   According to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the FSLIC's parentagency, the insurance fund will collect about $2.2 billion a year inassessments from member S&amp;Ls.
Received from server -->   Under legislation passed by Congress in 1987, it has authority tosell bonds to raise another $5.5 billion this year and next. Plus,over the next five years, it expects to realize $9 billion from thesale of property previously owned by insolvent S&amp;Ls.
Received from server -->   The GAO is analyzing the FSLIC's finances to determine whether itfaces a cash crunch in the future. By the end of 1990, the bank
Received from server -->board will have issued $10.6 billion in bonds and, to date, it hasissued about $25 billion in promissory notes. The interest on those
Received from server -->obligations will run at least $3 billion a year.
Received from server -->   Bert Ely, a financial analyst in Alexandria, Va., said, ``I think
Received from server -->they're facing a cash crunch this year.''   The Treasury Department, according to administration sources whodeclined to be identified, is studying a number of options f money into
Received from server -->the insurance fund.   One plan would raise the money through additional borrowing.Taxpayers would pay the interest, but the money would be borrowed
Received from server -->``off-budget'' and would not add to the federal budget deficit. An
Received from server -->independent board, incor
Received from server -->pumping moreluding the Treasury secretary, would overseeregulators' spending of the new money.   The Reagan budget document, while withholding details of theTreasury plan, outlined its principles:   _Insured depositors will be protected.   _``Private resources,'' including additional money from the S&amp;Lindustry, ``should be fully explored before any public assistance isconsidered.''
Received from server -->   _Reform of the existing regulatory structure should be linked toany additional money.
Received from server -->   _``There must be full accountability to the president and the
Received from server -->Congress'' for any use of additional money.
Received from server -->   _Reforms should aim at maintaining ``market forces anddiscipline.'' The document did not explain precisely what was meantby that phra   Reagan called, too, for eliminating subsidies that help runsubways and bus services and terminating a program that keeps airservice for many small communities.
Received from server -->   Doctors would have to accept smaller fees for treating theelderly under Medicare and the poor under Medicaid. Radiologists,
Received from server -->anesthesiologists and surgeons especially would get less.
Received from server -->   The nation's six million boat owners _ weekend sailors andcommercial fishermen alike _ would have to buy a $25 Coast Guarddecal to help defray the costs of rescues in emergencies.   Homebuyers would see a nearly four-fold increase in the 1 percent
Received from server -->fee for VA loan guarantees. It would rise to 3.8 percent under
Received from server -->Reagan's proposals.   He proposed eliminating the 1990 cost-of-living increase inpensions received by federal retirees and reworking the formulaunder which COLA increases are granted so that the retired workerswould have to absorb the first 1 percent increase in the annual cost
Received from server -->of living.   Workers who lose their jobs to foreign competition now get weekly
Received from server -->benefits while they look for other work. Reagan proposed eliminating
Received from server -->a program which he said works ``to benefit one group ofunderemployed workers or uncompetitive firms.''</TEXT>

Received from server -->   Speculators bailed out of the coffee futures market Monday in afrantic, technically inspired sell-off on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp;
Received from server -->Cocoa Exchange although fundamental factors continued to pointtoward higher prices.
Received from server -->   On other markets, frozen pork-belly futures plunged; soybeanfutures fell sharply; precious metals were mixed; energy futuresrose; and stock-index futures advanced.   Most coffee futures contracts settled 6 cents a pound lower, the
Received from server -->permitted daily limit for price movement. The limitless contractsfor delivery in March and May settled 9.43 cents and 8.75 cents
Received from server -->lower, respectively, with March finishing at $1.4829 a pound.   ``What we saw today was a wholesale bailout of speculativelongs,'' or players who previously had bet that prices would rise,said Kim Badenhop, a coffee-market analyst with Merrill Lynch
Received from server -->Capital Markets Inc.
Received from server -->   Analysts said that after reaching a 27-month high of $1.669 a
Received from server -->pound last Tuesday, profit-taking had brought the coffee market downby Friday's close to levels that triggered Monday's sell-off.
Received from server -->   The surge in coffee prices during December was rooted intight-supply, strong-demand fundamentals, including a drought in thecoffee-growing regions of Brazil and the arrival of winter in the
Received from server -->Northern Hemisphere, the annual peak period for coffee consumption.
Received from server -->   Analysts said those factors remained in place.   ``The long-term fundamentals suggest we would move to the upside
Received from server -->but it gets kind of scary when you get sell-offs like this,''Badenhop said.   Frozen pork bellies for both February and March delivery plunged
Received from server -->the 2-cents-a-pound limit on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,illustrating the market's potential for strong downward moves on
Received from server -->only moderately bearish news.
Received from server -->   The rise in supplies of frozen pork bellies last year to
Received from server -->near-record levels has caused a good deal of consternation among
Received from server -->analysts but has had little impact on prices.
Received from server -->   But Friday's quarterly hogs-and-pigs report from the AgricultureDepartment, although by no means an overwhelmingly bearish report,apparently was enought to trigger Monday's sell-off.
Received from server -->   The report showed a 2 percent increase over the previous year inthe number of pigs that producers expected to be born from December
Received from server -->through February.
Received from server -->   ``The baby pigs born in December, January and February areslaughtered in June, July and August,'' said Tom Morgan, president
Received from server -->of Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington Heights, Ill. ``If theDecember-February farrowings really do go up 2 percent, that means
Received from server -->the summer slaughter will go up 2 percent and that's bearish for thebellies.''
Received from server -->   Hog and cattle futures finished mixed.
Received from server -->   Live cattle settled .30 cent lower to .20 cent higher withFebruary at 73.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .62
Received from server -->cent higher with January at 84.97 cents a pound; live hogs were .75
Received from server -->cent lower to .35 cent higher with February at 46.37 cents a pound;frozen pork bellies were 2 cents lower to .80 cent higher with
Received from server -->February at 42.45 cents a pound.   Soybean futures fell as much as 12 cents a bushel on the ChicagoBoard of Trade on forecasts for rain in Argentina, the world'sfourth-largest soybean producer, where early growing conditions have
Received from server -->been dry.
Received from server -->   Wheat and corn futures finished mostly higher, although thosemarkets also were pressured late in the trading session by theArgentine rain forecasts. Oats ended sharply lower.   Further selling of soybean futures was prompted by the
Received from server -->Agriculture Department's announcement late Friday that privateexporters had reported cancellations of sales of 240,000 metric tonsof U.S. soybeans for delivery to unknown destinations, which tradersand analysts said probably meant the Soviet Union.
Received from server -->   Wheat settled unchanged to 1{ cents higher with March at $4.48} abushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to { cent higher with March at
Received from server -->$2.89\ a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 5 cents lower with March at$2.37} a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents to 12 cents lower with

Received from server -->Commodity Exchange in response to the early strength of the dollar,but platinum futures rebounded on the New York Mercantile Exchangeafter the dollar weakened late in the day.

Received from server --><TEXT>
Received from server -->   President Reagan on Monday sent Congress a
Received from server -->$1.15 trillion budget that is certain to be changed by
Received from server -->President-elect George Bush and a Democratic-controlled Congress.
Received from server -->   The plan would continue Reagan's legacy of military growth,squeezed social programs, and optimism that the federal deficit willdisappear without a major tax increase.
Received from server -->   In his proposals for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, 1989,Reagan advocated terminating a total of 82 government programs,
Received from server -->slashing spending on farm programs by $9.7 billion and trimming thegrowth in Medicare and Medicaid, the giant health programs, by about
Received from server -->$5 billion. The Pentagon's budget, on the other hand, was awarded abig spending increase.
Received from server -->   Here is a look at the major items:</TEXT><NOTE>MILITARY</NOTE><TEXT>   President Reagan's proposed budget would escalate ``Star Wars''
Received from server -->research and move several big-ticket weapons into production, whilesustaining current levels of military forces.   Reagan requested $315.2 billion in budget authority _ a 2 percent
Received from server -->increase after inflation _ for national defense in fiscal 1990.
Received from server -->   The defense budget envisions that $303 billion of the $315.2
Received from server -->billion will be paid out during the fiscal year. The balancerepresents money that would be authorized for various programs butnot spent until later.
Received from server -->   Of the totals, $305.6 billion in budget authority and $293.8
Received from server -->billion in outlays is earmarked for the Defense Department. Theremainder _ $9.6 billion in budget authority and $9.2 billion inoutlays _ is contained in the Energy Department's budget to covernuclear warhead production and research work.
Received from server -->   Bush has talked of cutting the request so that it just matches
Received from server -->inflation instead of providing real growth.</TEXT><NOTE>HEALTH AND SOCIAL</NOTE>
Received from server --><TEXT>   Reagan proposed increasing spending for AIDS research andprevention by 13 percent while reducing the growth of the Medicareand Medicaid health programs by cutting payments to states,
Received from server -->hospitals and physicians.
Received from server -->   Overall, the budget of the Department of Health and Human
Received from server -->Services _ the largest federal department _ would increase 5.7
Received from server -->percent to $424.4 billion in fiscal 1990. HHS spending accounts forabout 37 percent of the federal budget.   Medicare and Medicaid have been fueling the growth of thedepartment's budget.
Received from server -->   President Reagan said his proposed cutbacks would not reducebenefits to the 56 million elderly, disabled and low-income people
Received from server -->in the two programs, but would force the states, which administerMedicaid, and providers paid by Medicare to become more efficientand reduce waste.</TEXT><NOTE>EDUCATION</NOTE>
Received from server --><TEXT>   Bush, who promised to be ``the education president,'' will need
Received from server -->to rework this proposal to incorporate his ideas.   The Reagan plan would eliminate two dozen federal education
Received from server -->programs while slightly increasing overall education outlays from$20.6 billion this year to $21.2 billion in fiscal 1990.
Received from server -->   Some $541 million saved by the cuts, plus another $212 millionfrom cost savings officials hope to achieve from the guaranteed
Received from server -->student loan program, would go to expand existing programs fordisadvantaged students from kindergarten to graduate school.
Received from server -->   The Bush ideas not incorporated into this budget include a $500million merit schools program for schools serving disadvantaged
Received from server -->children and a $50 million infusion for a magnet schools programdesigned to encourage parental choice.</TEXT><NOTE>FARM</NOTE><TEXT>
Received from server -->   Reagan wants a 19 percent cut in Agriculture Department spendingin the 1990 fiscal year, including cutbacks in farm commodity
Received from server -->programs and the likelihood of even deeper reductions in the future.   Other proposed cuts for the fiscal year include spending for
Received from server -->forestry, farm loan programs, community and rural development and
Received from server -->some child nutrition programs.
Received from server -->   Under the proposed budget to operate USDA in the year that willbegin Oct. 1, total spending would be held to $42.4 billion, downfrom the estimated outlays of $52.1 billion in the current fiscal
Received from server -->year.   Spending on the department's Commodity Credit Corp. programs,
Received from server -->which includes wheat, corn and other major crop supports, would
Received from server -->decline to a six-year low of less than $11.6 billion from more than$13.8 billion in 1989.</TEXT><NOTE>WATER PROJECTS</NOTE>
Received from server --><TEXT>   The administration sought funds for 10 new flood control andnavigation projects, including several Congress refused to launch
Received from server -->last year.   It requested $88.5 million in its fiscal 1990 budget for the Army
Received from server -->Corps of Engineers projects. Six were in last year's Reagan budget,but Congress refused to start any. The four new projects are in
Received from server -->Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.</TEXT>
Received from server --><NOTE>VETERANS</NOTE>
Received from server --><TEXT>
Received from server -->   Congress was asked to approve a small increase for veterans'medical care and pensions as the president proposed outlays of $29.9
Received from server -->billion for the new Department of Veterans Affairs.   Outlays for the Veterans Administration, which provided benefitsand services to veterans for 58 years, are estimated to be $29.2
Received from server -->billion in fiscal 1989.
Received from server --></TEXT><NOTE>SPACE AND SCIENCE</NOTE><TEXT>   The controversial space station program would get $2.1 billion inspending authority in 1990, along with an extraordinary three-year
Received from server -->advance commitment for billions more.   The suggested spending limit for the space station during the 12months beginning Oct. 1 is more than double this fiscal year's limit
Received from server -->of $900 million for building the huge station.   In general, Reagan's budget is generous to big science,
Received from server -->supporting not only the $16 billion space station but also the $4.4
Received from server -->billion superconducting supercollider proposed by the Department ofEnergy.</TEXT><NOTE>SAVINGS AND LOANS</NOTE>
Received from server --><TEXT>   The savings and loan crisis was dumped into the lap of Bush,acknowledging for the first time the government does not have enough
Received from server -->money to bail out the troubled industry.   The administration, in its proposed budget for fiscal year 1990,outlined plans to spend $64 billion from the Federal Savings and
Received from server -->Loan Insurance Corp., from 1989 through 1994. Of that, $16 billionwould be spent in fiscal 1989, which began last Oct. 1; $9 billionin 1990, and $39 billion from 1991 through 1994.
Received from server --></TEXT><NOTE>NUCLEAR</NOTE><TEXT>
Received from server -->   Reagan proposed increasing by half a billion dollars the down
Received from server -->payment on modernizing and cleaning up the nation's atomic weapons
Received from server -->complex _ a job expected to cost $81 billion over the next 20 years.   In his proposed fiscal 1990 budget for the Energy Department,which makes the nuclear bombs and warheads for the Pentagon, Reagan
Received from server -->asked for $3.014 billion for moderninizing, environmental and safety
Received from server -->programs at the weapons plants. That is $478 million more than is
Received from server -->being spent on them this year.</TEXT><NOTE>TRANSPORTATION</NOTE>
Received from server --><TEXT>   The administration is proposing $28.2 billion in spending for
Received from server -->fiscal 1990, an increase of some $200 million. Requested funds for
Received from server -->air transportation would increase by about $1 billion, with thelargest chunk going to modernize the air traffic control system.
Received from server --></TEXT>
Received from server --><NOTE>FOREIGN AID</NOTE><TEXT>   The administration asked for $13.2 billion in outlays for foreign
Received from server -->aid, with $3 billion in spending authority earmarked for military
Received from server -->and foreign assistance to Israel, while Egypt was to receive $2.3billion. For the first time since 1986 the budget also asks for
Received from server -->enough money to cover the entire U.S. contribution to the UnitedNations and other international organizations.

Received from server --><NOTE>JOBS</NOTE><TEXT>
Received from server -->   Outlays for job training and other employment assistance would be$6.15 million under the 1990 budget, down by $74,000 in the current

Received from server --></TEXT><NOTE>WHITE HOUSE</NOTE>
Received from server --><TEXT>   Reagan wants to spend $28.5 million for the White House office,
Received from server -->compared to $27.7 million in the current fiscal year. Spending for

Received from server --></TEXT><NOTE>CENSUS</NOTE>
Received from server --><TEXT>   While most federal agencies are struggling with spending cuts or
Received from server -->small increases, the Census Bureau would get nearly triple its
Received from server -->current amount under President Reagan's 1990 budget.
Received from server -->   But don't get too excited, it's only temporary.   Reagan proposed Census Bureau spending of $1.47 billion for
Received from server -->fiscal 1990, up from about $250 million in 1988 and about $559million in the current year.
Received from server -->   The reason: the ``decennial'' census.

Received from server --><DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
Received from server --><TEXT>   The massive securities fraud trial over
Received from server -->Washington Public Power Supply System's $2.25 billion bond default
Received from server -->officially ended Monday with formal dismissal of the jury.   The trial had been expected to last at least a year, but
Received from server -->out-of-court settlements with all the defendants made the
Received from server -->proceedings unnecessary.   The 11 women and seven men on the panel had sat in court for 32
Received from server -->days since Sept. 7 and heard 27 days of testimony from a single
Received from server -->witness, a WPPSS employee who was the liaison with 88 public utilitydistricts.
Received from server -->   Those districts had contracted with WPPSS to build the powerplants, which were abandoned unfinished in 1982. In 1983 WPPSS
Received from server -->defaulted on the bonds sold to finance the project.
Received from server -->   A class of more than 24,000 bond investors and Chemical Bank ofNew York, a trustee for bondholders, sued more than 100 agencies,
Received from server -->consultants and individuals. They charged that the defendants
Received from server -->conspired to lie to prospective bond buyers.   Many jurors said they followed U.S. District Judge William D.
Received from server -->Browning's instructions against forming an opinion on the case until
Received from server -->they heard all the evidence.   However, Tucson meat cutter Filiberto Islas, 53, said he was
Received from server -->``kind of leaning'' toward the defendants, saying he heard nothing
Received from server -->that would indicate conspiracy or fraud.   Don Valdez, 36, a Tucson elementary school teacher, said he
Received from server -->``couldn't really form an opinion'' based on the sole witness'stestimony.
Received from server -->   Juror Jane Gerdes said she would have liked to deliberate averdict but felt the settlements saved the court money and gavebondholders some compensation.
Received from server -->   ``I was thinking that if they settled, it would be financiallybetter for everybody,'' she said.   Browning told the jurors he felt the case ``would not havesettled had we not sat you down and started this trial. So your
Received from server -->service here was very valuable.'' He also praised them forattentiveness to the complexities.
Received from server -->   By the time the jury heard opening arguments, 20 defendants
Received from server -->remained in the trial.   With out-of-court settlements, the number had dwindled to one
Received from server -->defendant and the class plaintiff when the trial recessed Dec. 5 fora month.   Blyth Eastman PaineWebber Inc., the WPPSS former finanical
Received from server -->consultant, ended need for continuing the trial by agreeing tosettle out of court for $25 million.   Browning still must hold hearings on the fairness of 16
Received from server -->settlements and how the money should be distributed. Those arescheduled to be in the spring in Seattle, although a date has notyet been set.
Received from server -->   A new trial would be ordered for the parties in any settlementBrowning might reject.
Received from server -->   With the three other settlements worth $107 million Browning hadapproved in June, the settlements total $700 million, plus whateverthe plaintiffs can recover from $50 million in disputed insuranceclaims.
Received from server -->   WPPSS will not pay any money as part of its settlement with theplaintiffs. The state of Washington pledged $10 million and the
Received from server -->federal Bonneville Power Administration, the power broker for thePacific Northwest, agreed to pay $35 million into the settlement pot.</TEXT></DOC>

Received from server --><TEXT>   About 100 General Motors Corp. Buick Division
Received from server -->workers will be laid off as the automaker cuts production of its
Received from server -->Reatta luxury two-seat car, a company spokesman said Monday.   Larry Gustin said production levels at the Reatta Craft Center in
Received from server -->Lansing would be cut Feb. 13 from 56 to 42 cars daily.   Some of the layoffs would come as early as Jan. 20 when the plant
Received from server -->is shut down for installation of a new paint process and some newtooling for a Reatta convertible, Gustin said.
Received from server -->   There are about 780 employees currently at the plant, whichproduces only the Reatta.
Received from server -->   Overly optimistic sales forecasts prompted the cutback, Gustinsaid.
Received from server -->   ``The manufacturing operation had been set up in a moreoptimistic mode than our forecasts,'' Gustin said, in part because
Received from server -->of yet-to-be seen convertible sales.   Originally, the Reatta convertible was to be introduced late last
Received from server -->fall, but Gustin said company officials decided more development
Received from server -->time was needed and put off introduction of the soft top until fall1989.   Analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International
Received from server -->Inc. of New York, said GM had ambitious production schedules during
Received from server -->the last three months of 1988. The monthly sales rates of Reattarose during the second half of last year compared with the first
Received from server -->half, to 480 cars a month from 272.   Most of that increase came in the last quarter.
Received from server -->   Between Reatta's introduction Jan. 15, 1988, and the end of lastyear, Buick dealers sold 4,514 of the cars.
Received from server -->   ``We have forecast 7,000 to 8,000 in sales for the '89 modelyear,'' Gustin said.
Received from server -->   ``It's still a momentum-building car looking for a new marketniche,'' he said. ``I think the manufacturing side felt that we
Received from server -->would do better than that.''   The front-wheel-drive Reatta, which retails for $26,700, has as
Received from server -->its only options a 16-way adjustable driver's seat and a power

Received from server --><DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   National Semiconductor Corp. has
Received from server -->agreed to sell half its mainframe computer business to Memorex Telex
Received from server -->NV for $250 million in cash and 4 million shares of Memorex Telexstock, the companies said Monday.
Received from server -->   National Advanced Systems of Santa Clara, which will become ajoint venture of the two companies, is the largest distributor of
Received from server -->IBM-compatible mainframe computers and data-storage devices made byJapan's Hitachi Ltd.
Received from server -->   Memorex Telex, based in Amsterdam, is the world's largestsupplier of IBM-compatible equipment such as terminals, data-storage
Received from server -->devices and communications equipment.   The Dutch company is privately held, so the value of the 4
Received from server -->million shares that National Semiconductor would receive in the dealis difficult to estimate.
Received from server -->   National Semiconductor's main business other than mainframes is
Received from server -->computer chips. The company said the sale of half of NationalAdvanced Systems would give it cash for future investment needs and
Received from server -->help the competitiveness of the mainframe unit.   Under the deal, Memorex Telex would get an option to buy the rest
Received from server -->of National Advanced Systems at a later date.   ``Even though this is being called a joint venture, I really
Received from server -->don't see that there's much doubt ... of the acquisition of NAS byTelex somewhere down the road,'' said Bob Djurdjevic, president of
Received from server -->Annex Research Inc., a computer market intelligence firm based inPhoenix.
Received from server -->   Memorex Telex has annual revenues in excess of $2 billion. It ismade up of the Memorex business, formerly owned by Burroughs Corp.,and Telex Inc. of Tulsa, Okla. Tulsa remains the U.S. headquarters
Received from server -->of Memorex Telex.   Djurdjevic said that since Memorex Telex already has a large debt
Received from server -->burden, it made sense for the company to pay partly with stock and
Received from server -->to stretch the expected purchase of NAS over a period of time.   National Advanced Systems, which has annual revenues of $900
Received from server -->million, will operate as a separate entity with headquarters inSanta Clara.
Received from server -->   ``This relationship should prove beneficial to both companies and
Received from server -->to our combined customer base,'' said Giorgio Ronchi, president andchief executive officer of Memorex Telex. ``Through cooperative
Received from server -->programs, we will substantially enhance the worldwide PCM market.''   Memorex Telex operates in 27 countries worldwide, with
Received from server -->distributor links in another 50 markets. It has some 2,200 employees

Received from server -->   President Reagan on Monday sent Congress hisfinal budget, a $1.15 trillion plan to continue his legacy of
Received from server -->military growth, squeezed social programs, and as-yet unrealizedoptimism that the federal deficit will disappear without a major tax
Received from server -->increase.   President-elect Bush praised the effort, but reiterated his
Received from server -->intention to alter its design within weeks. He is expected to seekless military spending to make room for his priorities: a cleaner
Received from server -->environment, better education and child care. Then Congress willrewrite it again.
Received from server -->   Like all his others, Reagan's ninth budget is out of balance. But
Received from server -->this deficit, at $92.5 billion, would be the smallest since the yearhe took office. When fiscal 199 ends on Sept. 30, 1990, the
Received from server -->accumulated national debt will exceed $3 trillion _ three times whatit was eight years ago when Reagan took office promising a balanced
Received from server -->budget in three years.   Reagan blamed Congress for his deficit reduction failures and
Received from server -->tried again to persuade it to eliminate many domestic programs. This
Received from server -->time, he proposed to save $4.9 billion by killing 82 of them _ manypreviously preserved by Congress, like subsidies for mass transit,
Received from server -->rural development and export business.   Farm subsidies and child nutrition programs would be cut by $9.7
Received from server -->billion. Limits would be placed on the growth in Medicare, whichprovides health insurance for Social Security recipients, and
Received from server -->Medicaid, which covers poor people, saving $4.9 billion.   But Social Security itself is unscathed.
Received from server -->   Military spending would increase $5 billion, to $303 billion, andthe nation would begin to build a permanent manned space station.
Received from server -->   About $6 billion would be raised by selling government assets,and another $1 billion would come from increasing fees for various
Received from server -->government services. Several corporate taxes would be cut _ by atotal of more than $2 billion.
Received from server -->   The resulting $92.5 billion deficit would meet the $100 billion
Received from server -->target of the Gramm-Rudman, deficit-reduction law, and represents asharp reduction from the $161.5 billion the White House anticipates
Received from server -->in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.   ``This budget shows that a gradual elimination of the deficit is
Received from server -->possible without raising taxes,'' Reagan said in his budget message.``It can be done in a reasonable, responsible way _ with discipline
Received from server -->and fairness. New taxes are not required.''   Bush concurred.
Received from server -->   ``The budget submitted by President Reagan today is an excellentbudget which demonstrates clearly that the (deficit-reduction)
Received from server -->targets ... can be met and indeed exceeded without raising taxes,''said Bush in a statement.
Received from server -->   ``Naturally, I support its intent,'' he continued. ``However, I
Received from server -->will continue to review it for possible amendments after I assumethe office of the presidency.''
Received from server -->   The Democratic-controlled Congress plans to relegate Reagan'sproposals to the status of reference books until Bush decides which
Received from server -->of it he will embrace and which he will change.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, labeled Reagan's
Received from server -->plan ``largely irrelevant,'' and House Speaker Jim Wright called onBush to announce his own plans soon.
Received from server -->   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., new chairman of the House BudgetCommittee, saw no surprises in the document, which he called ``the
Received from server -->last will and testament of the Reagan administration.''   ``The real question is whether the priorities of the outgoing
Received from server -->administration will be renewed or rejected by the newadministration,'' Panetta said.
Received from server -->   ``It provides a formula for a meaner, harsher America rather thana kinder, gentler one,'' as Bush promised, said Senate budget
Received from server -->chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn. ``It would be a serious mistake for
Received from server -->George Bush to dress up Ronald Reagan's budget in slightly differentclothes and expect it to be the basis for constructive budget
Received from server -->debate,'' he said.   Panetta and Sasser have been openly skeptical that Bush can
Received from server -->comply with the Gramm-Rudman law while keeping his campaign promisesand still avoiding a tax increase.
Received from server -->   House Republican leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., predicted Congresswould accept the Reagan budget's underlying assumption that the
Received from server -->economy will remain strong with moderate inflation and interestrates. Reagan has been frequently criticized as too optimistic.
Received from server -->   Overall, the budget proposes collecting $1.059 trillion in
Received from server -->revenues and spending $1.152 trillion, leaving a deficit of $92.5billion.
Received from server -->   One ingredient of Reagan's budget which automatically takeseffect, unless vetoed by Congress, is a 50 percent pay raise for the
Received from server -->cabinet, members of Congress, judges, and the federal government'stop managers.
Received from server -->   Elsewhere in the budget, but only if Congress approves, is aproposed 2 percent pay increase for rank-and-file federal workers,
Received from server -->3.6 percent for the military. Federal pensioners would get zero,their cost-of-living increase for next year canceled, although
Received from server -->inflation this year is running about 4.4 percent.
Received from server -->   The president's budget reflects the persistent demands on theTreasury to bail out insolvent savings and loan institutions,
Received from server -->costing taxpayers $16 billion this year and $9 billion next year.Some $80 billion might be needed over the next few years, but Reagan
Received from server -->leaves it to Bush to find the resources.   The continuing banking crisis and last summer's drought were
Received from server -->among the chief reasonsthe administration's deficit estimate for thecurrent year was raised to $161.5 billion, up from $145 billion
Received from server -->estimated last August, according to Joseph R. Wright Jr., thepresident's budget director.
Received from server -->   The budget also proposes $3 billion to clean up and modernize the
Received from server -->government's aging nuclear weapons plants. The Energy Departmentestimates the project could cost as much as $128 billion over the
Received from server -->next two decades.   For the military, Reagan sought to extend his influence halfway
Received from server -->into Bush's first term by submitting a two-year spending plan,including sharp increases in spending on anti-satellite and
Received from server -->anti-missile weapons.   Reagan asked for $315.2 billion in military spending authority
Received from server -->for fiscal 1990, of which $303 billion would actually be spent
Received from server -->before the end of the fiscal year. The spending authority includes
Received from server -->funding for long-term projects and weapons buying in future years.   For fiscal 1991, the president requested $330.8 billion in budget
Received from server -->authority and $314.4 billion in actual outlays.   On the domestic side, the president proposed spending increases
Received from server -->in select areas, including aviation safety, toxic waste cleanups andthe search for a cure for AIDS. The $1.4 billion increase in the
Received from server -->space program includes money to begin building the space station and
Received from server -->launch 9 shuttle flights, and the budget also includes $250 millionto start work on a superconducting, supercollider physics laboratory.
Received from server -->   The Reagan budget includes no general tax increase, although $1billion in new fees would be imposed for a variety government
Received from server -->services, including a 1 percent increase in the charge for veterans'
Received from server -->home loan guarantees.   Commercial and recreational boaters would have to pay a $25
Received from server -->annual fee for using waterways patrolled by the Coast Guard. Ascheduled cut in aviation taxes would be canceled.
Received from server -->   All state and local government workers would be required to paythe Medicare tax, raising about $2 billion.
Received from server -->   Meanwhile, corporate taxes would be cut under several proposals,
Received from server -->including a $1.7 billion tax break for corporations operating abroad.   Reagan told a business group Monday that because of the current
Received from server -->economic expansion, ``the revenue is literally rolling in.'' The$370 billion in additional taxes expected because of the bigger
Received from server -->economy by 1994 means ``plenty of money to do the business ofgovernment.''
Received from server -->   ``Raising taxes would be the surest way of killing the economic
Received from server -->goose that lays the golden egg,'' the president said.   In his eight years in office, Congress passed and Reagan signed
Received from server -->13 separate tax increases that will cost taxpayers $150 billionduring the next budget year. Reagan-era tax reductions will save
Received from server -->taxpayers $377 billion next year, according to the budget documents.

Received from server -->   Prime Computer Inc.'s president told securitiesanalysts Monday the computer maker's operating income could rise as
Received from server -->much as 50 percent in 1989, but only if it wards off a hostile $970
Received from server -->million takeover bid by MAI Basic Four Inc.   ``We have received expressions of concern from a number of our
Received from server -->large customers ... about the highly leveraged entity that wouldresult from a takeover and whether they would still buy from such a
Received from server -->vendor,'' Prime chief executive Anthony Craig said in an interviewafter the meeting.
Received from server -->   Wall Street analysts said Craig told them that Prime could lose$40 million to $100 million in orders if it is acquired by MAI
Received from server -->Basic, a Tustin, Calif.-based computer company controlled by New
Received from server -->York investor Bennett S. LeBow.   ``It was stated quite harshly, but in terms of the numbers, it
Received from server -->wasn't a fall-off-the-chair impact,'' said Barry Willman, whofollows Prime for Sanford Bernstein &amp; Co.   Said Willman, ``$40 million to $100 million to my mind isn't thatmuch, in terms of the corporation,'' which reported sales of $1.16
Received from server -->billion in the first three quarters of 1988.
Received from server -->   Prime stock closed at $19.25, up 12{, on relatively heavy tradingof 580,000 shares.
Received from server -->   MAI Basic spokesman Peter Rosenthal said the firm would notcomment on Craig's remarks.
Received from server -->   A Massachusetts judge temporarily enjoined MAI Basic on Dec. 29from pursuing its $20-per-share cash tender offer, saying LeBow had
Received from server -->failed to make full disclosure of his financing arrangements with
Received from server -->Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. But MAI Basic said it would go back tocourt this month to submit further information and try to clear thebid, which totals $970 million.   Craig said the main purpose of the meeting with analysts was to
Received from server -->``give a good news flash on our expected fourth quarter earnings''
Received from server -->because ``there had been divergent estimates in the absence ofinformation.''   The 43-year-old executive, who was named in October to succeed
Received from server -->Joe M. Henson as Prime's president, said fourth-quarter revenue isexpected to increase by 7 percent to 10 percent from $391.4 million
Received from server -->in the prior quarter. Net income is expected to rise more than 40percent over the third quarter's $11.7 million, he said.
Received from server -->   Craig said Prime has completed its acquisition of GeneralElectric's Calma subsidiary, giving the company approximately 800new customers and $60 million to $70 million in revenue in 1989.
Received from server -->   Prime announced Dec. 28 it would eliminate 1,200 jobs in 1989,bringing its worldwide work force down to about 11,600. The company
Received from server -->also cut 700 employees last year after buying Computervision Inc.
Received from server -->for $435 million.   Craig said the 1988 restructuring succeeded in rolling back costsby about $50 million, and that Prime expects to cut costs by a
Received from server -->similar amount again this year.
Received from server -->   He told the analysts he expects a 6 percent to 8 percent increasein revenue this year and a 10 percent to 12 percent rise in 1990,primarily because of strong growth in sales of computer-aided designand manufacturing systems.
Received from server -->   The combination of sharp cost cutting and revenue growth, he
Received from server -->said, could produce a 40 percent to 50 percent increase in operatingincome in 1989 and a 20 percent to 30 percent increase in 1990.</TEXT></DOC>

Received from server -->   Ford Motor Co. on Monday recalled about300 of its 1988 heavy-duty trucks to install parts omitted during

Received from server -->of the omission in the trucks, which are more than 8,500 pounds ingross weight.
Received from server -->   Meantime, the company also recalled 25,000 Sables because a clearbulb, instead of an amber one, was installed in side marker lamps.
Received from server -->   Owners of the affected vehicles will be notified by mail andproblems will be corrected free of charge, the company said.
